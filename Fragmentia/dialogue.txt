I rest my head against the window; the vibrations allow for a wave of comfort as I gaze into the stars.
The view is beautiful, the night sky bereft of clouds.
There's just something about the stars; they appear so timeless, so still.
But in the bigger picture that's far from the truth. They're individual solar systems orbiting our galaxy too. 
As for timeless, many stars have deceased by the time their light has reached Earth.
Will I echo beyond my death in such a way?
It makes me wonder where life is taking me.
I'm a cog in the smaller picture, coerced by momentum.
A jarring screech sinks my heart into my stomach...
Blinding light stings my eyes.
\"Doctor, he's stirring!\"
Footsteps scramble around me.
I manage a squint.
My gaze flitters along a line of foreign faces, coming to rest on the one closest.
\"Can you tell me your name?\"
My name? My name...
Where am I?!
Seized by panic, I rise; the movement rips a groan of agony from my throat and wrestles me into submission.
My lungs collapse to the pain of every breath.
I. Can't. Breathe!
I gasp for air and choke, reaching out to the doctor with curling fingers; he gestures orders to his colleagues.
\"He's going into shock!\"
Dread consumes the world around me.
When I wake, the doctor from earlier is examining me.
It would feel intrusive but for his drawn eyes and worried frown.
Knowing I'm awake, he leans closer.
\"Are you OK?\"
\"Who... are you?\"
My voice strained and dislocated; it hurts to breathe too deep.
\"I'm Doctor Gerald. I'm glad to see you're awake, and so soon.\"
\"Can you tell me your name?\"
My... name...?
\"I... can't.\"
He pulls a clipboard from the side and scribbles frantically.
\"Do you remember what happened?\"
I can only shake my head. His frown tightens.
\"You were in a terrible car collision.\"
He takes a deep breath, as if performing a rehersal.
\"I sincerely regret to inform you...\"
His features fall and his gaze rests on the ground.
\"...Your parents are dead.\"
His delivery suggests impact, but I have nothing.
I turn from his grave expression and lift up my gown.
Bruises descend my ribcage, hues ranging from bright blue to deep purple.
My left leg enveloped in a thick cast.
\"What's my... name?\"
A man bursts into the room with a panicked expression.
\"Peter!\"
His erratic entrance drawn to a stupor as he takes in the sight of me.
It takes a moment to realise he's addressing me. My... name... Peter.
\"W-who... are you?\"
\"It's me, your Uncle Benjiro.\"
He lurches forward, hand fumbling inside his jacket.
\"Do you not recognise me?\"
He continues before I have the chance to respond.
\"Are you OK? I...\"
His voice cracks. He musters a breath and masters himself.
\"After hearing the news... I'm just glad you're OK.\"
\"It hurts... so much. I can't... remember anything.\"
Relief washes over his features; his fingers caress my cheek.
\"I'm just glad you're OK...\"
\"I'm always here for you. My home is yours when you're fit to leave.\"
His reassurance makes me feel a little better, but only because of how lost I feel.
\"I'm sorry to spoil the reunion, but it could take months, even years before he's ready.\"
\"It appears Peter is suffering from some form of amnesia.\"
Nine months later.
I wake up everyday, nothing to rise for.
I manoeuvre my slouch towards the TV, knocking over a few empty cans as I locate the remote.
The drab titles protest with snippets of picture and audio.
Nothing. Nothing until the end of channels.
I rest my gaze on the ceiling and sigh.
\"Another bank robbery has taken place, this time in the city of Bristol.\"
It grabs my interest.
That's our local city; my uncle shops there.
\"Authorities haven't confirmed whether it's a succession to the—\"
\"Bored?\"
His voice rips my attention from the broadcast. How long has he been stood there?
He scans the surrounding mess. Here we go.
\"How do you live like this?\"
I don't. I exist like this.
\"What did I tell you to do yesterday?\"
\"To clean up, but I couldn't sleep last night.\"
He points a furrowed brow that seems to say, \"can you ever?\"
\"I specified in the morning.\"
\"I'll clean up later, OK?\"
\"You realise you're due to start school in a week, right?\"
He inspects his watch, drawing a wince from me.
\"It's half-one in the afternoon for Christ's sake.\"
\"Aren't you at work today?\"
Annoyance drips into my tone. He sighs, kneading his temples.
\"No, it's Saturday.\"
\"Oh.\"
I shrug; it's not unusual for me to lose track of the day.
I feign interest in the report, hoping he'll leave.
But he places himself on the couch next to me.
I shuffle to the arm due to the odour of stale alcohol and remnant perfume.
Come to think of it, I didn't hear him return last night—he must've been out all night drinking again.
\"Peter, we need to talk.\"
My fingers flex into the cushion.
\"About... my...?\"
He's mentioned so little; their deaths have been a looming shadow.
I wasn't even able to attend their funeral in my first month in hospital...
\"No.\"
He dismisses it again. A taboo subject.
\"You're no longer going to attend a local school or live here with me.\"
I gasp, but he continues.
\"I've arranged for you to move into a boarding school up north.\"
My stomach sinks.
Not only did he lie about the school...
\"But... you said you'd be here for me.\"
\"You should've told me. Why didn't I get a say in this?\"
He graces my shoulder with a few awkward pats.
\"I'm afraid I have too much work. I'll be unable to care for you.\"
Not like you cared anyway.
\"I can motivate myself and attend school here.\"
\"Then you'll be fine living on your own in dorms, right?\"
It's annoying that he's right, that I can't find a legitimate reason...
\"It'll be better for you to get out into the world and meet new people, y'know.\"
\"It'll do you no good to continue living like this.\"
That only serves to piss me off further. He suggested that I take the remainder of the school year off.
\"I can still do that here, though.\"
\"No, you can't.\"
His tone suggest it's his way. It's always his way.
\"You're such an arsehole; I can't believe I trusted you.\"
A sharp regret strikes before the words leave my lips.
He shoots to his feet.
\"Believe me, this is the best thing for you. The best thing for me.\"
His words slice in a seething calm.
\"So get yourself packed and ready, you'll be leaving next week.\"
His glare flitting between me and my mess.
\"Clean this shit up.\"
\"I'm going to bed.\"
There are a few people scattered across the seats. I'm just thankful they're out of view.
My book's lying across my lap—the words left begging. My mind too distant to read.
Every rotation inflates my anxiety like a balloon.
They say be careful what you wish for.
I wished to get off that couch.
I wished to meet people.
I wished to do something more with my time.
I wished...  I could start a new life.
Yet, here I am, dreading the opportunity.
Though I left on good terms with my uncle, his words fester.
Best thing for him... to get rid of me?
I don't blame him. I've been nothing but a burden.
I press my cheek to the window, the vibrations offer solace.
But buildings and traffic now rush past the window, having left behind the fields and streams of the countryside.
It marks a shift; I'm already losing what little I'd come to know.
Somehow, it all seems so familiar.
...
The time on my phone reveals three more hours left of this journey.
The joy.
I'm greeted by a smog of car fumes and cigarette smoke.
The offenders surround me, sharing the small shelter at the entrance.
The downpour has people scrambling to their taxis. I yearn for a prompt arrival as they pull off.
But I was forced to travel by train from the hospital, after having a panic attack in my uncle's car.
The image of the backseat sinks into my stomach and bile rises to my throat.
I swallow the lump and shake the thought, pulling the makeshift directions from my pocket.
I travelled the journey via Duudle Maps, recording street names as I scrolled through.
The end result is a list of street names and little sense of direction—the map's images taken in daylight.
I shoulder my duffle bag and extend the handle on my suitcase. The wheels protest in my wake...
Though I've seen it a thousand times on TV, I feel lost and insignificant immersed within the metropolis.
Commercial buildings rise into the grey-painted sky, adorned with advertisements; model faces apply mascara, blissful couples frolic in the sun, and gritty alpha-males emerge from explosions.
When my gaze descends, neon lights attract my eyes to numerous entrances.
They seem to swallow the bustling people.
When I observe people, I realise how alone I really am.
Smokers pour from bars and pubs, sharing banter and laughter.
Couples walk by, sharing the shelter of their umbrellas. 
And others share the refuge of the bus stops; their faces gloomy and impatient, merging into the scene.
I stop to switch the weight on my shoulder. I feel their stares.
Their gazes a burden, as heavy as—if not heavier than—my luggage.
I approach the school complex, thankful to underestimate my makeshift directions.
As I stop to rotate my luggage again, a weathered man approaches in a guards uniform.
His smile wrinkles up to his eyes lined with age.
\"New arrival, I see.\"
\"Yeah...\"
Rain trickles from the rim of his guard's cap.
\"Welcome to SunnyVale.\"
It extracts a wry smile as I wipe rain from my brow.
\"What's your name?\"
\"Peter Enning.\"
He swipes a pen across his device and punctuates with a final stab.
\"I'll take you to reception.\"
I gather my belongings and prepare to follow.
He contacts another guard to relieve him of the gate. Who arrives before we're even ten feet into the grounds...
My shoulder screams for him to hurry...
\"I'll go and find Cheryl for you. I won't be a moment.\"
I stare after him, following his trail of glistening raindrops.
The word \"slug\" springs to mind.
When he turns the corner, I'm left to the room.
Pamphlets and notices adorn the back wall, leading to the kiosk with no receptionist; seats situated around the two large pillars through the centre.
I rest my luggage and slump myself along a row of seats, kneading the knots from my aching shoulders.
The TV displays pictures of students. They perform tasks that don't merit their candid smiles.
I mean, who smiles whilst studying?
I'm distracted by shouting in the back; he re-emerges with an apologetic smile.
I rise to my feet, trying to impede his view of the damp stain across the chairs.
\"I'm ever so sorry. You've just missed the lady who operates the machine for your card-key.\"
I sigh despite myself.
It's my fault. I was supposed to catch the train by noon but I was still asleep.
\"Card-key?\"
\"They're a staple of the school. They allow for access and identification, effectively replacing the bog-standard uniform.\"
Great. So not only am I stuck here, I have nowhere to stay.
I'll admit—even in the circumstances—I'm relieved I don't have to conform to a uniform.
I'd appear like everybody else, despite knowing I'm... different.
They have lives... dreams... memories...
\"Oh.\"
He takes in my sunken features and offers a smile.
\"Don't worry, I won't leave you to die in here.\"
He draws a smile from me, which I'm quick to extinguish.
\"I'll contact Cheryl. I'm sure she hasn't gone too far.\"
\"Thank you.\"
Cheryl saved the day. Well, my night in this case.
Not only did she create my ID badge (that also functions as my card-key), she printed an information package for me, too.
I come to a stop outside room 117. My... home for the foreseeable future.
I place my card in range of the lock, a confirming green light grants my entry.
I'm greeted by a room so impersonal, you'd think it was expecting me. 
I rest my luggage by the door and flick the lamp on.
Bleak beige walls, ugly mismatching fabrics and longing storage space.
Chips and scratches blemish the wooden surfaces, testimonial to the character they once adorned.
Now they're stripped and left bearing scars...
I strip from my soaking clothes and throw them in the corner, deciding on a hot shower to drive out the cold settling into my bones.
I put my suitcase in the wardrobe—where it'll remain for a while, I'm sure—and get myself ready for said shower.
I'm struck by wry amusement to find the bathroom is more homely than my room. 
I approach the shower, but the mirror stops me in my tracks.
The reflection stares back. I struggle to associate the image as me.
But those haggard blue eyes... they're mine.
My hair short and dishevelled, descending to my chin that yields a meagre sum of whiskers.
I rip my gaze away and turn the water on, avoiding the image in the mirror as it warms...
I add to the pile in the corner and slump onto the bed.
My phone unable to provide distraction. It's filled with games that now lack my interest.
Hmm... I wonder if Destiny's online, it's been a while.
Damn, that's right. I haven't connected to the wi-fi.
Either way, I'd better get some sleep.
I flick the lamp off and get into bed.
My first day tomorrow...
The mention causes my mind to explode with possibilities.
Will I ever make friends? Is it even possible to start a new life?
I shuffle in the sheets, failing to find comfort.
I settle on my back in the end, staring into the dark, foreign ceiling.
The rain's stopped, leaving me shrouded in violent silence. Unrelenting darkness.
Gravity weighs on my aching limbs. Every breath contests the weight of my chest.
Aware of every heartbeat. Every beat breeds anxiety, but every beat is necessary.
Dissociative amnesia. Not caused by physical trauma, but repressed emotional trauma.
Face-to-face with it, after avoiding it for so long. I Free-fall into questions; nothing to latch on to, nothing to ground me.
Not knowing who I am, or what I want.
I rise and flick the lamp on, pacing to tame my racing thoughts.
Hollow groans erupt from my stomach.
It conjures the words of my therapist at the hospital: eating properly can stave your anxiety.
I'm not sure if I'd eaten breakfast this... 
...Afternoon.
It gives me an objective, something to focus on.
I grab my bag and head to the hall.
I shiver in the cold air that greets me and creep towards the kitchen.
Waking up people I'm about to spend the year with—at this time—wouldn't be the ideal first impression.
I freeze in the doorway when met by the back of a girl at the central counter.
Soft, rhythmic scratching hangs in the air, the only reminder that time's still in effect.
I jump to the springing toaster, slamming my bag against the door frame.
She spins; our gazes collide.
Startled into action, I initiate a greeting.
\"H-hey... I'm Peter. I've—\"
She glimpses my crotch area wide-eyed and turns away.
Comprehension sends a flush creeping up my cheeks.
My boxers...
\"Uh...\"
She wrenches the pad from the counter and clutches it by her leg, knuckles whitening around the spine.
She poises herself, as if measuring her escape.
I move from the doorway and she bolts through.
Her toast left protruding from the toaster.
\"Hey, wait! Your...\"
Realisation stomps on my tongue.
Unless I want the rest of my new neighbors to see me in my boxers too...
I didn't see which door she went in, either. And I'm not prepared to test my luck.
I prepare my food and head back to my room.
I set my plate on the side table and slide into bed, flailing in the sheets and wringing them to my lips.
\"How could I be so stupid?\"
Mentioning ideal first impressions—that wasn't one.
I'm not living at my uncle's now. I can't keep moping around in my boxers.
Now she's going to think I'm a weirdo.
I hear a door creek and the rhythmic pitter-patter of footsteps along the corridor.
I urge to apologise, but I can't bring myself to face her after that.
My stomach whines, so I nibble on my sandwich to appease it.
1:07am. It's going to be a long night...
My alarm rips away the sanctity of sleep.
I'm forced to open my eyes in my attempts to silence it.
I groan and stretch my tender limbs. Yesterday's travel did a number on me.
Despite the rising urge to set a snooze, I peel myself from the sheets.
I scramble through my duffle bag for clothes and my rolled up school bag.
I'm thankful to find a map of campus in the information booklet Cheryl printed.
My stomach curdles with every step, as if death itself was waiting beyond that door.
Well, that's what this primordial anxiety would have me believe.
It has me considering whether to skip class today.
I could turn back—
I jump to the sound of the bell. I hear a few people laughing behind me and assume it's my startlement.
I nerve myself and enter.
A plump, greying lady rises from the front desk and turns to me.
\"Just in time...\"
Her voice deep and raspy for a woman; she casts an ominous glare that accentuates her chiseled frown.
I get the feeling I've just escaped a prison sentence.
\"As I was saying, we have a new student. If you would like to introduce yourself.\"
An expectant silence falls over the room, crushing air from my lungs.
I focus on the posters at the back to avoid eye contact and brush my fingers along my clammy palms.
\"Hey. The n-names... Peter.\"
I feel my voice catch and stutter so I take a deep breath in an attempt to calm myself.
\"I-I'm from a small village outside of Bristol; I moved to the school yesterday.\"
\"I... hope that I can get along with everybody.\"
I feel desperate after adding the last part, but I can kick myself later.
\"Tell us about yourself?\"
The question stumps me.
The posters exclaiming, \"The Art Club Needs You!\" and \"The Sunnyvale Synchronized Swimming Team!\" aren't helping either.
Could I... lie? Probably shouldn't.
I catch glimpses of Impatient faces and force out a response.
\"I like to watch... TV, I guess?\"
Snickers ripple across the classroom. A flush climbs my cheeks.
I'm given a disapproving frown from Mrs Brown.
\"Sit yourself down. The seat at the back there.\"
\"Yes, Miss.\"
I take my seat in the far corner, hyper-aware of people glancing and whispering amongst themselves.
I hear laughter and illogical self-conscious reasoning takes over.
They're talking about me. Is it my hair? My clothes? My... introduction?
\"Quiet!\"
Silence ensues after her roar.
\"As you all know, this is your final year...\"
Mrs Brown proceeds to drone about future opportunities, but my mind is miles away.
I don't even know who I was, so how can I decide who I want to become?
I'm ripped from my thoughts when she says we'll be splitting into groups; anxiety reawakens in my stomach.
Everybody's forming groups, I don't know anyone.
\"Yoo-hoo~! New guy!\"
A girl waves in my direction.
I scan the wall behind me and turn back to her.
\"Me?\"
\"Who else?\"
I shuffle my table and chair over, adding to the tumult of screeches.
\"Nice to meet you! I'm Jennifer and this is Danielle.\"
She takes my hand in both of hers and flails my aching arm. Danielle spares me a glance.
\"I'm Peter.\"
\"We know. You just said so at the front, silly!\"
Then why'd she call me new guy?
Mrs Brown places three booklets on my desk and I hand them out. Without thanks from Danielle, I note.
They pull out pens and leave me stranded. My stationary still in my suitcase...
Danielle is already writing, but Jennifer catches my helpless expression.
\"You OK?\"
\"I, er... forgot my pen.\"
The grin pulling on her lips leaves me unsettled.
\"I've got just the one!\"
She rummages through her pencil case with a chuckle.
She hands me a pink pen, complete with a bright pink tassel.
\"It suits you!\"
I cast a searching glance to Danielle, who presents me with no other option.
\"Thanks...\"
The title: Goals and Ambitions. Gee, lucky me.
\"If you would all like to fill in your forms. Remember that this is your final year.\"
Jennifer perks up with excitement.
\"I'm gonna swim in the Olympics!\"
\"What are you guys putting down?\"
She looks to Danielle for an answer, which she blanks.
Then to me...
\"E-erm... I'm not sure.\"
Danielle rolls her eyes. The first emotive gesture I've seen from her.
\"Didn't you do anythin' at your old school?\"
\"N-no...\"
\"So all you did is watch TV? That's so lazy!\"
The words like a punch to the gut, echoes of my uncle.
\"You should totally come swimming with me! If that's not your thing, then Danielle—\"
An inconspicuous elbow cuts her off mid-sentence; Jennifer's lack of reaction implies it's a common occurrence.
I'm left bemused.
\"What... was that about?\"
\"Nothing. Just write down what you want, both of you.\"
Have I made a blunder? Should I have greeted her properly or something?
She's spared me a glance; her first words blunt and deflective.
Jennifer seems oblivious to her venom.
\"What crawled up your arse and died?\"
Maybe not.
\"I'm trying to concentrate.\"
\"...\"
Jennifer starts on her questions, I follow suit.
How would you describe yourself?
Well, I can leave that blank.
What are your strengths...?
Followed by three more pages that turn my stomach.
I've finished most of the questions, despite them being hard to answer.
But unease rises at the thought of killing time over lunch.
Maybe I'll head back to my room.
Or maybe—
\"Hey, wanna have lunch with us?\"
As if reading my thoughts—I catch myself suppressing a smile.
\"S-sure.\"
\"Brought your own lunch?\"
\"Yeah.\"
\"Good.\"
I glance to Danielle as we wait for Jennifer to shuffle through her bag and begin applying a top up of makeup.
She's prim and proper; she's the closest to resembling a \"proper\" student. Her eyes flicker in thought, but her face remains expressionless.
When her gaze returns I rest mine on the floor, willing Jennifer to hurry.
What's taking her so long...
...
\"You guys ready?\"
\"We were waiting for you.\"
They lead me out of a side door, with a few benches and the car park in view.
Each taking a seat on the benches situated together, leaving me with a quick choice of who to sit next to.
I choose Jennifer, who turns to me with a smile.
\"So, Peter, you're gonna come swimming with me, right?\"
\"E-erm... I guess I could try it.\"
\"Really? Yay!\"
She sticks her tongue out at Danielle.
\"See, people do like swimming.\"
\"Yeah. People who have nothing else to do.\"
Ouch.
Jennifer isn't offended in the slightest.
\"Aw, don't be so mean! He's just moved here.\"
She says after calling me lazy earlier.
She looks to me for a response.
I shrug and extract my pre-prepared lunch: ham and cheese sandwiches.
Thankfully, they drop the topic.
An aroma wafts from Jennifer's lunchbox; I find myself peering over for a better view.
She notices and catches my gaze.
\"Like what you smell?\"
\"Y-yeah...\"
She lifts out a wrap and displays it in her palm.
\"My chicken wraps are fit for a god. I have my own secret recipe.\"
\"They're not that good.\"
\"Hush, you can't cook.\"
\"Don't need to be a chef to know a good steak.\"
Danielle makes a fair point, but...
\"I must say the smell's amazing.\"
\"Maybe you'll be privileged enough to try them someday.\"
She gives a wink and gulps down a hefty chunk.
We eat in silence...
...it lingers beyond the packing away of our lunches.
They play on their phones, motivating me to fiddle on my own.
\"Don't talk much, do you?\"
Jennifer first to break the silence, prompting me to ask something on my mind.
\"Not really...\"
\"But I need the wi-fi code, do you know where I can get it?\"
\"I have it saved as a picture.\"
She hands me her phone and I connect.
\"Thanks.\"
I offer a smile as I hand it back, which isn't returned.
\"It's OK.\"
\"You got FaceAP?\"
\"No.\"
\"Get it and add me!\"
Caught up in excitement, she snatches my phone. Guess I have no choice.
I notice her phone buzz as she fiddles with mine, but she doesn't react to it.
\"Make an account, I downloaded it for you.\"
I'm interrupted from account creation by the bell signaling the end of lunch.
We grab our bags and head up.
As we make our way back, my impression of Jennifer being gregarious is fortified by numerous waves and greetings in the halls.
I'm glad she called me over. This is a start; I'm happy to meet new people—even if Danielle hasn't taken to me.
\"Peter, I would like to speak to you after class.\"
But my straying thoughts are stolen by Mrs Brown.
\"Ooh, you're in trouble!\"
Jennifer gives a teasing whisper as she walks by.
After making our way to our desks, we're instructed to reorganise.
Jennifer sheds her extra layer as I drag my table back into position.
Mrs Brown starts the first lesson of the day: maths.
She scribbles equations down on the whiteboard; students put their hands up to answer.
I can't focus on the lecture at hand. The lack of sleep has done a number on my concentration.
I've also spent so much time watching TV shows, documentaries and reading books, my concentration lapses without adequate stimulation.
And they always skip the boring parts in the stories...
The bell signals the end of the day. My first day.
It went better than I'd imagined. To think I'd considered skipping class.
Students rush to the door. Jennifer stops and waves before she leaves.
\"Bye, Peter! See you tomorrow.\"
\"See ya.\"
I intend to follow but I'm frozen by Mrs Brown's voice ripping through the air.
\"Peter, where do you think you're going?\"
I resign and make my way to her desk. She regards me in silence until we're alone.
\"What are these answers?\"
\"I... I don't know what you mean.\"
\"You left your personal description blank for a start.\"
To my chagrin, she begins reciting my answers from a piece of paper.
\"Your strengths are, and I quote, 'making a mess and watching TV.'\"
\"Your only weakness being 'memory.'\"
\"Y-yeah...\"
She considers me, a quizzical tilt lining her brow.
\"I've been instructed to refer you to our counsellor. But... what have you been doing?\"
Counsellor? Has my uncle told them...?
She continues after my lack of an answer.
\"I'll reprieve your answers for now. But if I find out there isn't good reason, there will be hell to pay.\"
\"Go. The counsellor's office is down the stairs on the left-hand side.\"
\"Yes, Miss.\"
The man spins to face me in his chair, flourishing his arms in a gesture to sit down.
Despite his formal attire, he's slack with unkempt hair.
\"Welcome, I'm Mr Adams.\"
He looks barely older than a student, but his smile uncovers this deceit.
\"I'm Peter.\"
His weakening smile lets me know he already knew.
What else does he know?
\"So, you think nothing of yourself, huh?\"
I freeze. His assessment hits too close to home.
He observes my discomfort, making me realise his assessment stems further.
\"Sorry, bad joke. But why didn't you answer the question?\"
So my uncle hasn't told them? But he must've contacted them.
\"I... I didn't feel like answering.\"
His frantic scribbling reminds me of the doctor. Only now do I notice my booklet beneath his notepad.
\"That's OK. Many people find it hard to describe themselves.\"
He slides it out, scanning through my answers with a furrowed brow; his gaze still locked as he speaks.
\"Your uncle notified me that you may require special attention. Though, he specified it's personal to you.\"
I feel a small sense of pride from my simple deduction.
I'm glad he didn't. It was a taboo subject when I enquired.
\"He set up weekly appointments for me to keep an eye on you.\"
On cue, his eyes rest on me.
\"I see.\"
\"How's the move been thus far?\"
I shrug; I'm unsure myself.
I didn't want to come here, but I can't deny it's not as bad as anticipated.
I've even made a friend, I think. When I add Jennifer on FaceAP that is.
He measures me with a scratch of his chin.
\"I'll postpone that question, give you some time to settle in.\"
\"We don't have time for a formal appointment today, either.\"
He tuts a rhythm while checking his computer.
\"A week today, same time.\"
\"Don't forget.\"
He points to my booklet.
\"Your memory is your weakness, after all.\"
I can only offer a forced smile as I think of a segue.
Something strikes me.
\"What are you going to say to Mrs Brown?\"
\"Don't worry, I'll deal with Mrs Brown. I've heard she can come down hard on students.\"
He gives a playful wink.
\"Tha—\"
Gentle taps on the door interject us.
\"Just a minute!\"
\"I'll see you next week, Peter. I'm sure you'll settle in fine.\"
He initiates a firm shake before I leave.
I'm frozen in the doorway. It's that girl from last night; her gaze resting on her feet.
Her eyes widen when she glances up.
Once again, I find myself an obstacle and move from the doorway.
She offers a queasy smile and flees into Mr Adams' office.
I can't help but be curious. She's so... mysterious.
Why was she up so late? It strikes me as weird.
Then again, I'm also weird by that standard—and beyond.
I realise it's the first time I'm not in a rush when reaching the dorms.
There's a small court with nets situated between the buildings; a few students are kicking the ball at an unfortunate student's rectum.
The most appealing part is the view of the distant forest.
I lean on the gate to take in the sight, but I'm distracted by the ball flying towards me.
\"Hey! Over here!\"
I slice the ball, which travels to the opposing goal.
He runs over, waving me to meet him half way.
\"That's terrible! Have you ever kicked a ball?\"
\"Can't say I have.\"
His amusement ends with a tilt of his brow.
I meet his extended hand; his shake a firm tug.
\"I'm Dean. When'd you move in?\"
\"Peter, yesterday.\"
\"Explains why I ain't seen ya before.\"
\"Wanna play?\"
I glance to my leg; my shin was shattered in the crash. There's a metal rod in it to this day.
I don't fancy having the ball blasted at my arse, either.
\"I... I really shouldn't.\"
\"Why not?\"
\"Come on! We need one more for even teams.\"
I don't feel comfortable explaining why and I can't think of a lie.
\"Erm...\"
\"Come on!\"
He slaps my shoulder.
\"It'll be too cold to play soon.\"
Maybe I can avoid a sore bottom if it's a normal game.
\"OK...\"
I fold, accepting against my wishes.
They begin arguing about who's team I should be on. I don't think I set a good impression with my first kick.
Finally, we set up into two teams of four and begin the game.
I'm exhausted. I excuse myself and sit on the sidelines.
One thing I've learnt from this: I'm terrible at football.
\"Done already?\"
\"Yeah. I'm going to head in. It was nice meeting you.\"
\"You can't leave now!\"
\"I have to go. Stuff to do.\"
He regards me for a moment. To be honest, I didn't convince myself.
\"Oh, OK. Peace, man.\"
But he can't anticipate how listless I am—yet.
I make my way inside to avoid further questions.
I fall face-first onto my bed, heaving for air.
I avoided the ball at all costs and I'm still tired. Thankfully, my leg doesn't seem to be aching,
My lungs calm. I roll over and draw my phone, opening the app and tapping a message to Destiny.
L0stc4us3: Hey, long time no speak.
A running joke we had that's for real this time.
To my surprise, her reply is instantaneous.
x-Destiny-x: Hey.
L0stc4us3: I've just moved into a new school.
x-Destiny-x: Really? Which school?
I'm glad she's making the effort. She was never one for conversation.
So I find myself keying in my location to a stranger.
L0stc4us3: Sunnyvale Academy.
...
But with that, the conversation comes to an end.
We met on an online game.
She referred to me as \"noob\" and introduced me to a clan to get me started.
Yeah. I didn't know her.
I decide to sign up for FaceAP.
After signing up and fiddling on the app, I realise it's boring with no friends.
A Search for Jennifer is futile without her second name.
Seized by a yawn, I stretch and lie back across the sheets.
The events of today reel back through my mind.
It's exhausting meeting new people, taking in new scenery and information.
But I can't deny the sense of accomplishment.
My heavy lids descend over my eyes.
I lack the will to protest.
I wake with a start, brushing sleep from my eyelashes.
What time is it?
My phone's blinding light merges into 11:34pm.
Damn. Somehow, I've made my sleep pattern worse.
Still no message from Destiny. Not that I expected one...
My stomach groans.
Once again, I haven't eaten.
My limbs protest as I hoist myself from the sheets.
I'm way too unfit.
I'd like to say it's the atrophy from being stuck in a hospital bed for three months, but I haven't done much since.
I navigate my way to the door with my phone's light.
And once again find myself on this corridor at stupid o'clock.
This isn't normal, but at least I'm dressed.
The kitchen light is on again...
I'm not surprised to see her. This time though, she notices me from the get-go.
\"I'm sorry about last night!\"
Words spill from my lips.
\"I... I didn't expect anybody to be in here...\"
It extracts a smile from her.
Although it's forced, it relieves tension. I seize the boost.
\"I didn't catch your name last time 'round.\"
I'm taking no prisoners. I at least have to find out her name.
She shuffles as if she's about to bolt again, but manages to master herself.
\"I... I'm Sarah.\"
\"It's nice to meet you, Sarah. I'm Peter.\"
\"How could I... forget?\"
By partaking in a traumatic car crash.
...
\"Anyway, I've been having sleeping troubles, so thought I'd make a brew. D'you want one?\"
She doesn't bolt when I move from the door way.
Instead, she accepts my offer with a nod.
\"How do you like it?\"
\"T-tea two.\"
\"Me too.\"
With nothing left to say, we sink into silence.
I stare at the static kettle, willing it to boil.
\"A...\"
She breaks the silence, but doesn't continue.
\"Huh?\"
\"A... watched kettle never boils.\"
\"You can say that again.\"
She reciprocates my strained chuckle.
I prepare each of our cups with a teabag and two sugars.
The kettle clicks on cue.
I position myself over the counter and place her cup next to her plate of toast.
She leans away, as if touching me would contaminate her.
\"So, what're you working on?\"
I tap the pad, achieving the opposite of my desired effect—relieving tension.
\"It's... it's just my art work.\"
\"Sounds interesting, can I see something?\"
She squirms at the question; it makes me feel like an interrogator.
I'm about to let it slide but for her sharp nod. She finishes off her toast and flicks the pad open.
\"T-this... is something I've been working on.\"
It takes a moment for the murky shading and outlines to consolidate into a picture.
Two facing silhouettes are wreathed by thick smoke.
Galaxies and nebulae swirl within them with a pleasant juxtaposition.
I notice smoke leaks into the male-like silhouette's mouth and wreathes nearby galaxies.
\"This is good. Will you show me when you've finished?\"
She remains silent, with an expression and nod that seem to say anything but yes.
\"I mean, you don't have to if you don't want to. I like it, though.\"
I'm surprised by the genuine smile tugging on her lips.
She finishes her tea in a swill and rises, taking her notepad in arms.
\"T-thank you for the tea. But... I must get to bed.\"
\"You're welcome. I should do the same.\"
I say that, but I haven't prepared my food yet.
She leaves as I finish off my tea.
She didn't say whether she'd show me, either.
I make a sandwich and head back to my room.
It's midnight. I'm not tired; I have nothing to do.
How I hate myself right now...
Morning comes. I haven't slept a wink.
I head out for a shower, in hopes it will wake me up for the day.
I'm... early. I don't think I've ever been early.
Maybe as a sperm. I can't imagine I'd win without a head start.
I flop my forehead on my clenched fists, wondering how Im going to make it through today.
I perk up when I hear Jennifer enter the room.
I glance over, but I'm quick to rest my gaze back into my laced fingers.
I wonder if she'll speak to me again.
\"Hey, Peter!\"
I turn back to her, unable to defeat the smile pulling on my lips.
\"Hey.\"
She parades over, with far too much energy this early in the morning. Or any time, for that matter.
\"You look better today.\"
It takes me off guard. Did I look that bad yesterday?
\"Oh. I hadn't slept well.\"
Or at all since midnight.
\"That's no excuse! You have to be ready for every day.\"
She draws her fists in an aggressive stance, jabbing the air.
\"Easy to say when morning's like caffeine to you.\"
\"They say life's a bitch. I'll kick her ass!\"
Waving her fist as if I was the aggressor.
\"Which means morning's nothing. It resides under my boot.\"
She extracts a chuckle from me.
\"I wouldn't wanna be life.\"
\"No, you wouldn't. That's why you should come swimming!\"
She takes on a proud pose.
\"I've already been this morning.\"
\"I'm not going in the morning.\"
I'm putting my foot down there, at least.
\"I have practice today. You could come, tomorrow, after school?\"
\"Maybe.\"
Mrs Brown storms into the room.
\"You will!\"
Jennifer flashes a wink and makes her way back to her chair.
Her whisper left hanging in the air.
Why does she want me to join her?
I don't even know if I can swim.
I keep drifting off and startling myself awake in fear of Mrs Brown's wrath.
Every time I try to focus on the work, the writing blurs across the page.
I watch the clock tick time away, each second longer than the last...
I force myself to look away, in fear of time stagnating completely.
When I make it back to my room I feel re-energised, after falling asleep all day. Typical.
But it works in my favour. I shouldn't sleep until later if I want to get my sleep schedule back on track.
If it was ever on track.
I kill time reading my book, but I catch myself yawning and my eyes closing.
I put it down and think of ways to keep myself awake.
My gaze comes to rest on my ransacked duffle bag.
Hmm... no.
Then my wardrobe.
Let's be real, that's not going to happen.
I pick up my phone and find myself messaging Destiny again.
L0stc4us3: Hey, long time no speak.
As I lay it down, it vibrates.
x-Destiny-x: Stop messaging or I'll call the police.
Wait, what? Is she joking?
L0stc4us3: Why would you call the police?
x-Destiny-x: Because you know which school I attend. I'm calling the police.
What the—she lives here?
L0stc4us3: Wait, stop! I swear I've moved to Sunnyvale.
I wait, but the response is futile.
Is she really ringing the police?
I send her my number, along with an invitation to ring me.
I rest my phone on the table and wonder whether that was a stupid decision.
What are the chances?
A stranger I used to speak to on the internet happens to go to the same school.
My phone startles me. I watch it dance across the side table. 
Unknown number, I brace myself and answer.
\"Heeeeeeeya, Peter!\"
Her greeting leaves me rubbing my ear.
Wait, Jennifer is...
\"Destiny?\"
\"Yes, it's destiny that we swim tomorrow.\"
\"No, I'm asking if you're Destiny?\"
\"I know I'm amazing but I'm not destiny.\"
Is she being cryptic?
No, she can't be. Destiny doesn't know my real name.
\"How did you get my number?\"
\"Well...\"
Out of all of this, I'm most surprised to hear her voice fall sheepish.
\"I called myself from your phone at lunch yesterday.\"
She giggles down the line.
\"I'm sorry. I should've asked you.\"
\"But you did say you'd come swimming with me...\"
I laugh in resignation.
\"It's OK.\"
My phone vibrates.
\"I've just received a message.\"
\"You can get to it, right after you agree to come swimming.\"
\"I said I would, didn't I? You said so yourself.\"
\"That's what I like to hear. Ba-bye~!\"
\"Bye.\"
My reply lost to the end call tone.
Why does she want me to come?
I'm not sure, but my mind is soon back on Destiny.
I check my phone to find a missed call and a message:
\"It's Destiny. If you've really moved here, meet me on the roof in twenty minutes.\"
Wait... which roof?
I message her as much, but there's no reply.
Well, I have twenty minutes to find it and something to keep me awake, I guess.
The roof...
Oh, that's right! My map.
I scan over it, but it doesn't cover the rooftops...
I make my way to the main building.
I was hoping to ask somebody for directions but the grounds are empty.
I find a nook and follow it out of curiosity. I have nothing else to go off.
Dumb luck is on my side.
These steps surely lead to the roof, but the sign on the pillar states, \"Authorised Personnel Only.\"
Maybe it's best that I didn't ask anyone.
I scan the area. Nobody.
I find myself climbing the steps, looking over my shoulder to make sure no one is privy.
The roof is vacant.
I'm not surprised, this place has seen better days.
Why would she want to meet me here? This doesn't seem like a safe place to meet a stranger.
...
It's been twenty minutes, she should be here.
I get restless and pace the roof, looking out through the fence.
It's like I'm on the divide between two worlds. The human world one way, the natural world the other.
The evening breeze whistles through the fence, drawing my attention back to the city.
It's like one giant organism from up here; humans like cells and streets like veins.
The buildings like organs I add as an after thought, just to complete the comparison.
As for me, I'm a foreign cell trying to adapt to this new biosystem. Trapped in the belly of the beast... 
\"It is you...\"
A familiar voice grabs my attention...
\"Danielle?\"
I'm frozen by her analyzing gaze. It's as if she's tearing me apart and reconstructing me in her mind.
\"You're the only new student in my class.\"
\"Lost Cause.\"
\"Explains why you don't know what to do with your life.\"
Ouch. She doesn't miss the opportunity.
I'm left tongue-tied. I can't deny it.
\"Have you played Smackdivision's new MMORPG, Magnum Dilon?\"
Prompted by the unexpected question, my brain lurches a response.
\"I... can't say I have.\"
How many times am I going to say that...?
\"It's good. It runs on the Ethereal engine.\"
That engine rings a bell...
\"Wait, didn't you start creating your own game?\"
\"I did.\"
Her tone stifled through her gritted teeth.
\"But I gave up on that. It was a terrible idea.\"
\"That sucks, I was on the shortlist. Have you started something new?\"
Her eyes narrow.
\"I have. I'm going to complete it this time.\"
\"Don't tell Jennifer about this, OK.\"
\"Why not?\"
\"Because she'll annoy me to no end.\"
I'm stunned; she was so cold yesterday.
Now I already know something about her that Jennifer doesn't.
\"Your secret's safe with me.\"
It pulls a scowl from her.
\"Good.\"
Unease strikes at the thought of holding it over her.
The setting sun recedes. A yawn seizes me.
\"Yes, I must get going. I altered my schedule to meet you here.\"
Schedule? Beyond school? My stomach falls at the thought.
\"Erm, thanks.\"
\"What for?\"
\"For not ringing the police, I guess?\"
A smirk tugs on her lips.
\"That's OK. Bye.\"
She turns on her heel and marches to the steps.
\"I'll see you tomorrow...\"
My words left to scatter in the wind.
I wake before my alarm. Despite twelve hours of sleep, I'm fighting to stay awake.
I kick off my quilt and the cold drives me from my pit.
A thought disturbs me as I dress: Jennifer wants me to swim today.
I roll up my trouser leg to reveal the scar tissue.
Two hairless spots of bright pink located above my ankle and below my kneecap, marking the incisions of the metal rod and screws.
I'm not ashamed of how it looks; I'd rather avoid questions I don't want to answer.
I'm... early, again.
There are a few people conversing in the classroom, so I wait outside.
I'm distracted by footsteps approaching from behind.
\"Hey.\"
\"Hey...\"
She fixes me with an expectant stare.
\"I.. er...\"
...Don't know what to say.
She takes a glimpse to each side.
\"Don't you play anything anymore?\"
\"No...\"
When I think about it, not since we stopped talking.
\"Not since Clubseal.\"
\"I haven't played it since we did.\"
\"Yeah... me either—\"
\"Hey, guys!\"
Jennifer waves from the end of the corridor and parades over.
Our conversation shunned at her arrival.
As far as Jennifer knows, I've exchanged a few words with Danielle.
I get the impression Danielle wants to keep it that way.
\"Hey.\"
\"We're going swimming after school, you should join us!\"
She pokes Danielle in the side, pulling a grimace from her.
\"No, thanks.\"
\"That's OK, we're still going.\"
She nudges me with her shoulder. Another reminder I'll be exposing my scars.
Danielle inspects her phone.
\"Class is starting.\"
We head inside and ready ourselves for class.
The end of school dawns, the prospect of swimming ever daunting.
The moment the bell rings, I spy Jennifer lurking in my peripheral.
She springs and lands by my desk, drawing a few glances from our exiting classmates.
\"Ready?\"
\"I guess so.\"
She's already off, it takes me a few keen strides to catch up with her.
\"So, how're you finding it here?\"
\"It's... not so bad.\"
I think that's a fair assessment.
I'm not sure why I had myself so worked up about coming here. Although, it's easier said in hindsight.
She laughs.
\"You don't seem too happy about it, leave something behind?\"
\"Or someone, maybe?\"
\"Come on, you can tell little old me~!\"
She probes my expression.
\"N-no, nothing...\"
Can you leave nothing behind?
Well, there was something I left: my existence. Which might as well have been nothing.
I shake my head of the reminder.
My apprehension saps away her curious excitement—we fall into silence.
She keeps twitching as if she's about to say something and withdraws.
When we reach the changing rooms, she breaks the silence.
\"So, are you any good at dancing?\"
My brow lifts to her question.
\"No, why would I be?\"
\"I'm just messing with you!\"
She grips my wrist and pulls me.
\"Come on, let's get changed!\"
Wait, together? I catch my tongue and ride it out.
I get myself changed but Jennifer's still in there. What's taking her so long?
I decide to head out on my own.
I've never been swimming before, but... here it goes.
\"Argh!\"
My breath rushes from my lungs, I'm quick to climb out.
The afternoon breeze pulls a shiver from me.
I glance around, hoping nobody was privy.
My head spins to a snicker from behind; our eyes connect.
I lower my head and she bursts into a fit of laughter.
\"Haha~! You're such a girl!\"
I have to admit, it's emasculating to be called a girl—by a girl I've met a handful of times.
\"It's cold! I'd like to see you jump in there.\"
Having now taken in the sight of her, I find myself taken back by her scantily-clad body.
\"Watch me!\"
She says it with an air of confidence that makes me want to eat my words.
I find myself swallowing them when she dives into the pool...
She resurfaces before me. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't impressed.
\"Go on, I bet you can't reach half way.\"
What have I gotten myself into?
I'm not sure, but my pride isn't about to let me back down.
I ready myself at the edge of the pool and take a deep breath.
I dive in, flailing my arms and legs. I find it's counterproductive as I've almost come to a standstill on a few occasions.
I feel my breath coming to an end, despite taking the largest breath I could muster.
I just have to make it half way, but I can't determine my location through my obscured vision.
I inhale a mouthful of water, plunging panic down my throat.
Can't. Breathe!
I thrash to the surface and gasp for air.
An image of reaching out to the doctor flashes through my mind.
I rest my torso over the edge of the pool, heart pounding against the ground.
She approaches as I cough and spit out water.
\"Are you OK?\"
I compose myself and crane my neck towards her.
\"Yeah... I'm fine.\"
I take a deep breath and rise without her help.
I've made it about a third of the way, but I can't care.
Her concern melts into a grin.
\"Can I ask somethin'?\"
\"...You just did.\"
The residing adrenaline results in a jibe.
She makes a movement as if she's going to jab my arm, but retracts her hand.
\"Silly! Anyway, have you swam before?\"
\"I... haven't. How'd you know?\"
\"Well, you'd know that the pool would be cold for a start.\"
\"Guess I can't argue with that...\"
\"You shouldn't flail your arms and legs, either. Get into a controlled rhythm or you'll waste valuable energy and oxygen.\"
\"Thanks for the tip.\"
\"What's with your swimsuit by the way? I haven't seen one like it before.\"
\"This is my outfit for the synchronised swimming team!\"
She shoots her arms into a V. I imagine for vendetta, against my sanity.
\"It's best for me to train in this as I'll have to perform in it.\"
\"So that's why you asked about dancing?\"
\"You catch on quickly!\"
She flashes a wink.
\"Anyway, I have my routine to attend to. You should find a rhythm and go from there.\"
\"Thanks, I'll give it a go.\"
This time I brace myself for the cold, easing myself into the pool and finding a relaxed rhythm.
My new methodical movements more efficient; my speed has increased and I exert less energy.
After a few measured lengths, I pick up the pace and find myself feeling... liberated?
Well I did, until I overexerted myself. My breath's ragged and my leg drags like lead.
I climb out and sit on the edge. My weight shifted to my right buttock, allowing my left leg to rest.
I proceed to rub my leg, pressing points to inspect the damage. It's nothing major, I've put too much strain on it.
Content it's nothing to worry about, I find myself captivated by Jennifer; who's going about her routine.
Her body is elegant. She glides from one end of the pool to the other as if every movement was choreographed.
The top half of her body submerges and her legs straighten out into the air; she performs a running like motion before flipping and resurfacing.
She wipes her eyes and spots me watching on the sideline.
I avert my gaze as she swims over.
\"It's OK. You can watch!\"
Her presumptuous statement—with my previous line of thought—brings a burning to my cheeks.
Her expression grows curious.
\"Are you OK?\"
\"Yeah! I'm fine, I'm fine...\"
It's a knee-jerk response.
There's no way I can tell her about the metal rod in my leg, or the potential impurity of my thoughts.
She measures my unnatural position and expression.
A questioning tilt lines her brow.
\"Are you about to fart?\"
\"No!\"
She laughs at my reaction.
\"I'm done for today, ready to head in?\"
\"Sure.\"
Happy to drop the subject, I rise with a wince. She misses it as she climbs out.
\"So, how'd you find it?\"
\"Huh?\"
\"Swimming!\"
\"Oh. A lot better after your advice, thanks.\"
I notice her glance at the scarring on my leg, but she doesn't say anything.
It's the most obvious scar on my body. I'm surprised she didn't notice earlier.
We share a few moments in silence before heading in.
She's taking longer than last time. Though, I'm not exactly sure why I'm waiting.
\"So, you'll come again?\"
\"Maybe.\"
\"You will...\"
She whispers and makes her way through the main doors.
I'm curious why she still wants me to come.
But it's nice knowing she wants me to.
I'm approaching my first weekend. My first week of school.
I'm beginning to feel this won't be so bad.
Though, my food is dwindling.
I'll be fine for tonight, but I should head out tomorrow and survey the area.
Content with my conclusion, I rinse my dish and rest it to dry.
As I exit the kitchen, Sarah appears through the far door.
\"Hey, Sarah.\"
\"Hey...\"
I approach her and realise I have nothing to say.
\"So... what're you doing?\"
\"Nothing...\"
She glimpses to room 119.
\"I see...\"
She's not making this easy.
\"I was wondering...\"
\"If you'd help me with the local area? I need to do some shopping.\"
I watch the conflict play out across her face.
\"S-sure.\"
She doesn't seem sure. I'm beginning to question whether she's capable of saying no.
\"I just need to... get my things.\"
\"Me too.\"
I head into my room to grab my bag and wallet.
Sarah emerges not long after. So 119 is her room.
\"Ready?\"
\"Y-yeah...\"
I set the pace and she trails.
She falls in step as we exit the building, pinning her eyes on the ground.
The silence deafening.
Speaking of deafening...
\"Hey, Peter! Cara!\"
Jennifer strides towards us. Sarah shrinks to her presence.
I glance behind us and shoot her a raised brow.
\"Cara?\"
\"...You mean Sarah?\"
A hint of red rises in Jennifer's cheeks.
I turn to Sarah; her head bowed and cheeks ablaze.
\"Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry!\"
\"I thought you said Cara when we first met! You remind me of someone I used to know...\"
I have to stifle a laugh at the situation.
But now we're stood in this awkward triangle, I feel responsible for Sarah's discomfort.
\"We need to get going. Right, Sarah?\"
Sarah's gaze fixes on the gate. I've made the right choice.
\"Yeah, me too. See ya around, guys!\"
\"Later.\"
\"B-bye.\"
Is she so shy she'd let someone call her by the wrong name?
It's an amusing thought, but it's cute.
I'm grateful for our saunter, my leg is still aching from swimming.
Sarah's silent.
I watch her curiosity sweep from the birds in the trees down to insects in the bushes.
She's always uneasy, yet unassuming.
It's conflicting, I don't know whether to be anxious or relaxed myself.
She shrinks in the city. I imagine she's as intimidated by it as me.
Her eyes flicker at people walking past, as if they were potential assailants.
Our silence unsettling; I search for a topic, the poster in class comes to mind.
\"So... are you in the art club?\"
\"N-no, I just like to... draw.\"
Her reluctance palpable. Maybe she wants to join but she's too shy?
Damn, I can't think of anything to say.
It makes me feel bad, for what feels like using her as a guide.
\"Here we are.\"
\"Thanks. What're you getting?\"
\"I don't... need anything.\"
\"Really? I feel bad for dragging you out now...\"
\"It's OK.\"
Her smile and tone genuine enough to put me at ease.
Still, I can't help wonder: does she feel a responsibility to help me or does she feel inclined because she's afraid to say no?
She leads me down the aisles, twisting her fingers in her sleeves.
She brings her sleeve to her lips and stares into the shelves.
It's as if she's disconnecting herself from her surroundings rather than browsing.
She just avoids a passing man, offering an apology he doesn't acknowledge.
\"S-sorry...\"
Sarah doesn't strike me as someone who's used to being acknowledged.
I think she'd prefer to merge into the background.
Like a picture...
I intercept her and lead the way, picking up groceries as we progress.
Sarah decides to grab a few loaves and some butter.
At least it wasn't a complete waste of time for her.
We make our way to the checkout. The cashier scans through my items.
\"That's nineteen pounds and ninety-one pence, please.\"
Damn, spent more than I thought.
I shell over the cash and he hands me my change and receipt.
\"Thanks.\"
My arms jolt to the weight of my bags.
I rest them aside and wait for Sarah.
\"That's three pounds and ninety-six pence, please.\"
She fumbles to both pay him and receive the bag.
I echo the cashier's smile.
She takes her bag and approaches with a wavering smile.
\"Are you...\"
\"Ready? Yeah, let's go.\"
The setting sun greets us.
Sarah lingers behind me.
I attempt to pick up the \"conversation\" from earlier.
\"So... have you considered joining the art club?\"
\"No...\"
But I'm shot down faster than last time.
This whole trip feels like a disaster.
I thought she'd open up a little, but it's stressed her out.
These bags are reawakening the ache in my arms, too...
Her shoulders fall slack when we make it back.
We head into the kitchen to deposit our goods.
She's packed away her things. I've still got two bags left.
\"Bye.\"
\"Thanks, I appreciate it. See you later.\"
\"You're welcome.\"
She fights a smile and heads back to her room.
I don't know what to think. She's an enigma.
I spend the morning playing any game of interest from the Appmarket.
I can see myself squandering another Saturday.
But after my productive week, it'd be a shame to revert so soon.
With little else in mind, I decide to explore the campus.
I might check out the art room, there seems to be a music room too.
I almost bump into Danielle as I turn the corner.
\"Hey. What are you up to?\"
Her expression shifts from a lifted brow to an easy smile.
\"I'm going to the staffroom.\"
\"What, why? You in trouble or something?\"
\"No.\"
She sighs in exasperation.
\"They let me use the computer room on weekends.\"
\"My laptop is laggy...\"
A drop of frustration mars her tone.
\"Oh, I see.\"
\"Want to join me? There's always a few free.\"
I can't deny that I'm curious.
She's seemed eager to talk to me; Jennifer has cut us short a few times.
\"Sure.\"
She turns on her heel and leads the way.
After visiting the staffroom, they let us in. It seems some of the teachers use the computer room on weekends too.
The teachers give greetings to Danielle, who only nods in return.
\"So, are you going to introduce us?\"
\"He's joining me.\"
She strides past, making her way to her goal.
Guess I'll introduce myself then.
\"Hey, I'm Peter. I moved in last week.\"
Another teacher turns in his chair, realisation glinting in his eye.
\"Peter. Nice to meet you, Peter.\"
I reach his extended hand; he shakes and pulls me in.
\"I'm new here, too. I'm Mr Brent.\"
\"Nice to meet you.\"
\"I thought I should introduce myself. It's hard being the new guy, wouldn't you say?\"
\"I guess so.\"
He turns back in his chair, grey coat swinging from the back.
I wait, expecting something more—it doesn't come.
Well, that was weird.
I follow Danielle to the far computers who meets me with a lifted brow.
\"Do you know him?\"
\"No, why?\"
\"He started two weeks ago.\"
\"I haven't heard him say more than a few words to anybody on his own accord.\"
I shrug it off.
I doubt I would've heard more than a sentence or two from Danielle if she wasn't Destiny.
\"Anyway, you should show me that game.\"
\"What was it again? Magnum... something.\"
\"Magnum Dilon.\"
We settle down on a computer each.
\"OK, give me a few minutes, I'll get you a code.\"
\"A code?\"
\"So you can play.\"
She proceeds and I take the opportunity to read up on the game.
Humanity has consumed the majority of the world's resources. People left to starve throughout kingdoms across the world, not deemed worthy of survival. Every country fought for a stake in the resouces, until four remained.
The four remaining races each developed technologies to form super soldiers. Each faction with a part to play in what the people rumour to be \"the end times of Earth.\"
My eyes come to rest on the price tag. I could afford it and its subscription fee, but it would be a dent in my funds.
\"Damn, this game isn't cheap.\"
\"It's OK. Type this in.\"
She motions to her screen. I lean back to find a serial number.
\"Wait, you bought an account for me?\"
\"No, I have ways.\"
\"That seems...\"
\"Don't question a freebie.\"
\"OK, OK. Read out the code.\"
She reads it aloud and I type it in.
\"That's my friend's account. Go to his level 37 Viktese Warrior.\"
\"OK...\"
\"I'll go on my level 29 Namrosian soldier and still beat you.\"
I forgot how competative she was.
I accept her invitation and the timer counts down.
3... 2... 1...
Fight!
We're summoned to Forest Fortress.
Small outposts are scattered through the trees, hidden by thick foliage.
Rope bridges run through the canopy.
Basics first, I find the attack button and slash through the air with my futuristic battleaxe.
Damn, the movement is slow, there must be someway...
I press through the controls and my character boosts through the air.
This will take some getting used to.
I spot movement in the canopy above.
I try to spot her with the awkward camera rotation.
When I catch a glimpse, it's too late—she buries her sword in my back.
\"x-Destiny-x is the victor\" slams onto the screen, cracking the make-believe lense.
I hear her chuckling behind me.
\"I see you're still a noob.\"
\"That's cheating. I don't know the controls yet.\"
\"Ignorance of law excuses no one.\"
\"I don't see how that applies here.\"
\"Do I really need to lecture you about how tough the world is?\"
\"It's just a game.\"
\"Then you shouldn't be upset about losing, right?\"
\"I'm not!\"
A few teachers glance over; her lips curl into a smirk.
\"Again?\"
I sigh in resignation.
\"After I've looked up the controls.\"
No use. She's too good.
I can't look at her, that smirk will annoy me.
\"Again.\"
She says nothing, but the counter ticks down...
She plucks me out of the air with her sword and slams me into the ground. Dead. Again.
I'm sure it's 11-0 to her.
\"I'm done.\"
\"...\"
\"...\"
\"I should probably head back. It was fun.\"
\"Yeah, for you I bet.\"
She releases her smirk.
\"You played me longer than most. It can't have been that bad.\"
\"I have a good mind to never play you again.\"
\"That's because you're a noob.\"
I can only laugh in the face of defeat.
\"Bye, Danielle. I'll see you around.\"
\"Bye.\"
I look back and she's still on the computer, despite her words.
Damn, I wanted to beat her. Still, I head out with a lazy smile.
Ah, that's right... I forgot to check out the art room.
Maybe another day...
Looks like an early night is on the cards, I couldn't imagine that a week ago.
But here I am, adapting to my new life, meeting people and making... acquaintances.
I can't say I've paid much attention in class. Though, I can say the work is harder than the basics in hospital.
I'm also adapting to this room, this environment.
This... new life.
My shoulders sink into the sheets, every breath feels lighter.
My mind calm.
I close my eyes, basking in relaxation.
Sleep caresses my consciousness. I fall into its grasp.
...
I slip into another world. I've been here before.
A watchtower looms on the hill next to a quaint village, lifeless streets and desolate buildings veiled by the gloom of its shadow.
Nostalgia washes over me.
This place... it's fuelled by dry ink and scattered pages.
My body carries me the same route, skipping the same parts of the journey: past the dilapidated church and tavern.
To the centre of town. Without fail.
A wooden shack rests in the middle, glowing through its crevices.
I shimmer towards it, like a moth drawn to its angelic light.
On cue, the door creaks open to reveal two angels.
They greet me with open arms. A heavenly aroma wafts from the bubbling pans.
When I enter, the female angel wraps me in her embrace.
I close my eyes, trying to savour the feeling of being in her arms...
That's odd...
The scents of hot iron and burning rubber coil in my nostrils.
She pushes me to arms length and digs her fingers into my shoulders.
Her shrill scream permeates the air.
My eyes open to her twisted features, they melt from her face.
She convulses and hauls me to the ground.
I wake on impact, gasping for breath.
Cold sweat wreathes my skin. Dried tears stain my cheeks.
I rush out of bed but my legs buckle. 
Though the ground finds me, my stomach remains in vertigo.
I flail on the floor, groping the fabric of the carpet and the panel on the desk.
Nothing feels real.
Panic wells into my heart...
The brunt of the anxiety passes, but embers reside in my stomach. 
I fear they'll reignite.
The more I try not to think about it, the more it festers.
Try not to think of a pink elephant and you shall.
...
That dream was once a comfort for me.
That house, those angels... were where I found peace. But it usually ended in her arms.
It's all so vague. I can't help think they're a subconscious portrayal of my parents.
She shares the same curly hair as my mother.
Maybe that hut was parallel to the life I once had.
A light in the darkness.
A light that was taken away.
Thoughts that lay burden on the rest of the day...
My mind's receded an inch. Everything feels so far away.
I'm not sure I'd have made it to class today without a day to recover.
The question lingers whether I should claim sickness to escape.
Students flood into the room—Jennifer conspicuous among them.
But right now, I don't feel like dealing with her... personality.
Of course, she approaches. Eye contact extracts a reflexive smile from me.
\"Hey, Peter!\"
But her glee grinds through me.
\"Hey.\"
I can't surpass a hollow tone.
\"Are you OK?\"
Confusion tilts her features. She reaches out but her fingers hover over my arm.
\"Yeah.\"
The word slithers off my tongue.
What should I say? No?
Should I spill my problems to a girl I've spoken to a handful of times?
We're locked in an uneasy silence.
Mrs Brown enters and marches to her desk.
\"...\"
Jennifer bites her bottom lip and returns to her chair.
She looked... worried.
Damn, she's been kind to me.
And I brush her off for talking to me. Through no fault of her own, no less.
If she hadn't called me over on my first day, I wouldn't have had the confidence to approach anyone...
I'm allowed to leave early for my appointment.
I should speak to Jennifer. She seemed concerned earlier.
I left for my room at dinner, needing time to think.
\"Welcome back, Peter.\"
He says with the same exaggerated flourish. I take the seat.
\"So, let's start where we left off: how's your stay at Sunnyvale?\"
\"It's... going OK, I guess.\"
I've met a few people; I've improved my practicality; I've motivated myself to attend school.
It's a start, right?
Putting everything into perspective lifts my mood.
It's just a dream, but the feelings it evokes...
He observes my brooding. It's subtle, almost... non-intrusive.
\"Can I ask the nature of your uncle's reference?\"
\"I... I don't want to talk about it.\"
\"You don't have to tell me what the problem is, but I could help you with the symptoms.\"
What, so you can figure out what's wrong with me? Like I'm some puzzle to be solved.
He takes my silence as a means to question.
\"Are you eating well?\"
\"I'm doing OK.\"
I fidget as I relay my answer.
\"What about sleep?\"
\"My pattern is a little messed up, but I haven't missed class.\"
\"Elaborate on 'messed up.'\"
\"I... often have late—\"
I cut myself off.
\"Let's just say I've had a few problems, but I'm adapting.\"
\"Good. Be sure to get yourself into a routine.\"
\"Your circadian rhythm regulates your mood.\"
\"I have some questions regarding your general mental health.\"
\"If you can just answer between one and five—one being not at all, five being consistently.\"
...
We run through a tedious list of questions. I relay answers he wants to hear.
\"Have you had any suicidal thoughts in the past week?\"
I reel back to his question.
\"One.\"
\"I wish I didn't have to ask, but it's a problem that's overlooked.\"
His voice growing solemn with every word.
I can't say the thought has never crossed my mind.
He takes a breath and moves on.
\"Speaking of sleep earlier, any unsettling dreams in the past week?\"
A cold flush descends over my face.
\"Two...\"
I avert my gaze. The scratching of his pen hastens.
Why didn't I just say one?
\"Thank you for your answers.\"
I shrug.
\"My main problems are that I don't want to sleep and I don't want to wake up.\"
We share a chuckle.
\"Yeah, like the rest of us.\"
His response fuels my smile. I can't pinpoint why.
\"Is that everything, can I go?\"
\"You're free to leave.\"
His hand reaches out as I rise; I hesitate to shake it.
\"Look, Peter... I'm here if you need anything, OK?\"
He places his other hand on the back of mine.
\"Take your time... But I can't help if you don't tell me.\"
\"Thanks...\"
He claps the back of my hand and releases me.
\"Take care of yourself, Peter.\"
\"Bye.\"
\"I'll see you next week.\"
I turn in a jumble of thoughts.
Is it that easy? Could I tell him my problems and they'll disappear?
I glimpse to him one last time before leaving. He smiles and waves me off.
No, of course it's not that easy.
He insists like I have a problem to confess.
I can't deny I have several to myself—it just annoys me.
I'm not about to commit suicide.
And the fact he's paid to pry into my life...
The thought leaves a slimy weight swinging in my stomach.
It's only a duty to care for me...
I don't know what to think; my weekend started well and ended in disaster.
That dream...
They say it's rare to have olfactory dreams, but the smells were so vivid.
And the angel's scream still echoes through the corridors of my mind.
All I know is, I don't want to be alone anymore.
I want to find that feeling of the angel's embrace.
A few gentle raps pull me from my daze.
Who the—
I open the door to find a fidgeting Sarah with her hands behind her back.
I step out and close the door to shield my mess.
\"Hey, Sarah…\"
She looks down to her shoes and twists her toe on the floor.
\"H-hey…\"
\"Is everything OK?\"
She meets my gaze with a sweet smile.
\"I… I've finished.\"
She pulls her pad from behind her back. It takes me a moment to register.
I echo her smile and latch onto the pad.
Her countenance unsure when it leaves her finger tips...
It now brings my parents to mind, evoking a sense of melancholy.
But the aesthetics are pleasing, every detail perfected. I've always had a thing for space.
\"Wow. Really, this is good.\"
\"Thank you.\"
\"Have you shown anybody else?\"
\"N-no...\"
\"You should.\"
\"I...\"
\"...I'll think about it.\"
I return her pad and she rushes for her room.
\"Wait, Sarah...\"
\"Hm?\"
\"I'll see you around.\"
\"Bye.\"
I watch her hide behind her door.
She... approached me.
If I didn't catch her with her pad at stupid o'clock, would it've been left unseen by the world?
It's a depressing prospect.
That picture... the passion it portrayed. Though I don't understand her reasons, it moved me for my own.
What do I want? I've been living a listless life since the accident.
I've often wondered who I was back then. I often wonder if there's anything left of who I was.
Besides memories, what makes a person who they are?
Appearance? Thought patterns? Interests? Memories...?
Everyone seems to have some kind of goal or a hobby. The more I think about it, the more alienated I feel.
My uncle's right about one thing: I can't keep living—no, existing like this.
I have a fresh start. I can be whoever I want to be. Or remain nobody...
It's like I can't resist taking a jab at myself.
I should be positive about this.
This move has been a forced restart. And not the first, I might add.
But sometimes things happen that are out of our control.
I guess it's how you react that ultimately decides the outcome.
I've been anything but positive up until this point, in either case.
I have to change.
But... where do I start?
I'm feeling positive today.
A good night's sleep can work wonders.
Jennifer enters. This time, I wave first.
She approaches with a curious smile.
\"Hey, Peter!\"
She searches my expression, clearly discouraged from yesterday.
I reassure her with a smile.
\"Hey.\"
I'm met by her grin.
\"You really do look better today.\"
\"Thanks, I do try.\"
She waves away my comment.
\"Was somethin' wrong?\"
\"No. I'm fine, really.\"
\"I bet you're not sleeping well again.\"
\"You need to toughen up!\"
She plants her fist on my shoulder.
\"Ow.\"
I rub my arm, more out of shock than anything.
\"That didn't hurt!\"
I rub harder, grin pulling on my lips.
\"Not sure I'll ever be able to swim again.\"
I tilt my head back in dramatic fashion.
\"I'll give you something to to \"ow\" about!\"
\"I'm joking!\"
Her features fall solemn.
\"But about swimming... would you come again?\"
She's actually asking me; she looks serious too...
I keel over my desk in feigned agony and snicker through my teeth.
\"I really don't think I can.\"
She waves her fist by my face.
\"If you don't stop being a drama queen, I'll make sure you never swim again!\"
I reel back into my seat with my hands up.
\"OK, OK! I'll come.\"
Her beaming smile reflects on my lips.
\"I'll catch you at the end of class and we'll go together!\"
\"Sure thing.\"
She turns with a flourish and heads for her seat.
What have I gotten myself into?
I'm not sure, but my smile doesn't falter.
Jennifer arrives at my desk in sync with the bell.
\"Let's go!\"
\"I didn't bring my shorts.\"
\"Go and get them. Hurry!\"
I rush back to my room and grab my bag.
Jennifer's waiting for me in her swimsuit.
She shoots a glance at my bag.
\"You're looking a little light.\"
\"Huh?\"
I open my bag and give her a view.
\"Looks like you forgot something.\"
I rummage through my bag non the wiser.
\"What gets wet as it dries?\"
\"...\"
\"...\"
\"No idea.\"
\"A towel, silly!\"
She thrusts her tongue at me.
Damn. I used it to have a shower.
\"Ah... I'll go and get one.\"
\"You can use mine after me.\"
\"Are you sure?\"
\"The lesson's started. Go get changed!\"
That's right... she had a lesson this time last week.
We're greeted by a lesson in progress.
Male-female duos are scattered across the pool, performing out of sync choreography.
The few on the sidelines are huddled around the instructor.
\"Come on!\"
A girl approaches, sharing a wave with Jennifer.
She pulls up and examines me.
\"This the new blood?\"
Jennifer shoots her a furrowed glance.
My stomach drops. It all adds up.
It's not that I hadn't considered an ulterior motive; I just didn't want there to be.
But... why else would she talk to someone like me?
\"It's nice to meet you. I'm Casey.\"
\"Peter.\"
They share a lifted brow at my deflated introduction.
\"Don't worry! You'll be working with me.\"
\"We might have to do extra practise, but you don't have much to learn.\"
\"I never agreed to water dance.\"
\"It's not water dancing, it's synchronised swimming!\"
\"I didn't agree to that either.\"
\"Aw.\"
Her bottom lip drops into a pout.
\"C'mon, it'll just be one move!\"
\"I... I'll think about it. OK?\"
\"Yay! Come on, you can at least try it today.\"
Not like I have much choice now...
Casey amused by our interaction speaks up.
\"Later, guys.\"
\"I'll see you later!\"
\"Bye.\"
After address the other students, the teacher sets his sights on me.
\"It's nice to see a new face. Are you joining the team?\"
Jennifer's stare bores into my cheek.
\"No, I'm just trying it out.\"
\"I see. I'm Mr Palmer, welcome.\"
He looks to Jennifer.
\"As you can see, we're working on our duet segment again today.\"
\"Once each duo has it mastered, we'll start synchronising as a whole.\"
The whole thing makes me nervous. I can barely swim, let alone dance.
I'm ready to bail at any excuse, but my mind fails me.
\"Don't look so worried.\"
She shoves me with her shoulder.
\"You won't have much to learn. You'll be helping me perform a few moves.\"
\"At least the pool isn't as cold today.\"
She turns away and presses her back against me. Her warmth tingles on my skin.
\"They turn on the heating for our lessons.\"
Her fingers wrap aroud my wrists and guide my hands to her body.
\"You just need to hold me up.\"
I lift her by her thigh and her abdomen, they tense in my palms.
Her weight tenfolds as her body submerges from the water.
She keeps wriggling, trying to get into the right position.
\"Hurry up.\"
I manage the words through the strain.
\"Hold it.\"
My arms begin to shake under the weight. It's embarrassing.
\"Release.\"
I lower her back into the water in relief.
\"See, that wasn't so bad.\"
\"I... guess not. But I can't hold you long out of the water.\"
Her brow lifts.
\"Why not?\"
\"You're heavy.\"
This earns me a swat on the shoulder.
\"You cheeky sod!\"
I'm quick to amend my faux pas.
\"I didn't say you were fat. Muscle has more weight.\"
She waves her fist at me but her lips pull in the corners.
\"Good. You better not be!\"
We rinse and repeat for the remainder of the lesson...
Everyone heads in to get changed and I'm left waiting for Jennifer.
She emerges with her towel held out; I take it and head in.
The scents of coconut and chlorine mix in my nostrils. I catch a last whiff as I hand her towel back.
\"Thanks.\"
\"So, Peter, you should come out with us!\"
\"Erm... I...\"
She shakes my shoulders.
\"C'mon! You always look so down. Loosen up!\"
She shoots a pout at me.
\"OK...\"
\"You'll come out this weekend? Promise me.\"
\"I said OK.\"
Geez, what do I have to do?
\"Pinky promise.\"
\"What?\"
\"We join pinkies and make the promise official.\"
\"O-OK...\"
She latches onto my pinky and pulls me close.
\"They used to chop off your pinky if you broke a pinky promise.\"
She steps back simpering.
\"So don't let me down~!\"
She turns and runs off, leaving me questioning whether there's a wolf behind her sheeplike innocence.
Jennifer Act 1
My alarm tears me from sleep. But consciousness feels light today.
As I get ready, something strikes me: Jennifer wants me to hang out.
Beyond swimming.
I'm fifteen minutes early. A new record.
\"Peter!\"
Her greeting draws a smile.
But when I turn to face her, I'm met by a pout.
\"Hey, what's up?\"
The table's turned.
\"You never added me on FaceAP!\"
\"Ah... you're right.\"
We both whip our phones out and search for one another.
\"There, added.\"
She giggles as she accepts my request.
\"Now you can't escape me!\"
So it's official? We're... friends.
I flash her a grin.
\"Maybe you should be the one concerned about escaping me.\"
\"Ah, Peter. You have much to learn.\"
She pats my shoulder and heads into class grinning.
My words were hollow, but she seems to have taken it as a challenge or something.
I'm distracted by a vibration as the lesson picks up.
FaceAP wriggles with a notification. I glance to Mrs Brown before opening.
Jenjen: How old r u? u havnt updated ur profile.
Seriously? She's looking me up in class?
I hesitate to answer...
Peter: 19.
...Being a year older will only raise questions.
I fix my eyes on the front, distracted by Jennifer shooting glances in my peripheral.
It's not long before another vibration.
Jenjen: So ur definitely comin out this weekend?
Peter: I pinky promised, didn't I?
Jenjen: U did, remember wat will happen if u don't. ;)
Jenjen: dont tell n e 1, ok?
Not like I have anyone else to tell.
Still, why wouldn't she want me to tell anyone?
A ball of unease has been expanding in my stomach all morning.
Is there an ulterior motive here too?
Why would a girl like her want to be friends with someone like me?
Why would anyone?
I checking my phone from time to time for a message or call to save me from myself.
I don't even know what time or where.
...
Finally...
Jenjen: we r heading into town, wanna join us?
Peter: OK.
Why's she acting like I didn't promise?
This girl is something else.
Jenjen: meet at front gate!
I arrive to find Jennifer glued to her phone.
She notices my approach and lowers it.
\"Hey!\"
\"So, where're we going?\"
\"We're gonna go get something to eat.\"
She looks into her screen and sighs.
\"We're just waiting for their slow arses.\"
She peers into the grounds.
\"Don't tell them I said that.\"
\"Tell who?\"
I follow her gaze to a familiiar figure.
It's the guy playing football outside the dorms. Dean, I think his name was.
\"Hey, it's you!\"
Apparently, he's forgotten mine.
\"You've met Peter?\"
\"Yeah, he played a game of football with us.\"
An elbow connects with my ribs.
\"I didn't realise you were so active.\"
\"I—\"
\"Don't tell me he's the one swimming with you?\"
\"Yeah!\"
She points her tongue at him and he rolls his eyes.
\"So you're the poor soul.\"
I almost respond with a yes but catch my tongue.
\"Arsehole!\"
A flying fist connects with his shoulder.
\"Did I just feel something?\"
He looks side to side in confusion.
Her high-pitched growl extracts a laugh from me.
\"What're you laughin' at?\"
She turns to me brandishing her fist.
\"You two.\"
Casey pulls up between them interjecting.
There's a prolonged moment of silence.
\"Let's go!\"
My mind wonders as Dean and Casey talk about random topics.
Something strikes me as off about the scene: Jennifer.
She's not at the forefront of the conversation. She's staring at her phone again, face expressionless.
I draw my phone and key in a message, \"This must be a record; I think the world might implode if you don't speak soon.\"
She smiles when our gazes meet.
\"Did u miss my voice already? ;)\"
Should've expected as much.
\"Geez, you can text as fast as you can talk. God save me.\"
I'm pleased with myself for extracting another smile.
But was something wrong? She's been—
\"arsehole! follow my lead.\"
This gives me a bad feeling.
\"Peter! You forgot to sign up for the team!\"
Jennifer exclaims, Casey turns with a curious expression.
\"I didn't ag—\"
She tugs my sleeve and starts dragging me.
\"If you apply by three pm, then you'll be able to practice again on Tuesday!\"
She assures to shout, perpetuating my gut feeling.
\"Later, guys!\"
They both gawp as I'm dragged away; I can only offer a queasy smile...
When we're out of view she lets go and peeks around the corner.
\"What's this about?\"
\"All part of my ploy. Casey likes Dean, but she won't admit it.\"
\"You're playing Cupid?\"
\"Pretty much.\"
\"But a ploy means it benefits you.\"
\"Oh.\"
Her hand comes to rest on my shoulder, lips pulling into a grin.
\"It does.\"
Her proud pose pulls a grimace from me.
Should've trusted my intuition.
\"What if I don't join?\"
\"Then you'd make a girl very sad.\"
Houston, we have a problem.
Her cute voice is activated and pout deployed.
\"No.\"
I deflect her attack with an averted gaze but she circles around.
\"Are you ignoring mwe?\"
I turn my body away.
She grabs onto my arm and yanks me close, nullifying my defencive manoeuvre.
\"Pwease?\"
I can't escape her coy pout or the feeling of her body pressing against mine.
She unravels me like a sweet.
\"I'm only helping you perform moves, though. I'm not dancing.\"
\"Yay! That's good enough for me.\"
I can't help smile.
\"I am hungry, though. Weren't we supposed to get something to eat?\"
\"We don't have time. Come on!\"
\"That's the whole reason we came.\"
\"Yeah...\"
Her eyes swim with a passing thought.
\"I'll make you one of my famous wraps some time to make up for it.\"
\"They did smell good...\"
\"They are. Let's go!\"
She tugs my sleeve and I follow.
Would it have mattered if I'd said no?
I signed up and Jennifer said she had to go. I can't help but think it's to do with her phone.
Who was she messaging? Or whose message was she waiting for?
I wonder why I'm curious.
Beats me. But it beats where my mind would stray.
I smirk as today's events reel through my mind...
The stealth text conversation; her scheming to get Casey and Dean together; her domineering perseverance convincing me to join the club.
I want to find reasons beyond her wanting me to swim with her.
But I can't seem to allow myself...
Speak of the devil.
Jenjen: meet us at 7 at the front gate and bring ur id!
Peter: What do you mean? We've already been out.
Jenjen: i asked and u came. tht wasnt the pinky promise.
Peter: That's not fair!
Jenjen: Wear something nice! ;)
Damn this girl. How didn't I see this coming?
I resign to having a shower and getting myself ready for tonight...
I feel fresh; it's the first time I've worn these jeans.
I hope I'm dressed smart enough. I don't know what the standards are.
Or where we're going for that matter.
Nervousness and excitement wage war in my stomach.
Thinking back on it, I had technically already been out. But… I can't deny I'm looking forward to seeing her again.
I end up leaving a few minutes late...
Jennifer's waiting alone. Weren't Dean and Casey supposed to be here?
\"Peter!\"
\"You look nice.\"
\"Thanks...\"
She strokes my chin.
\"But you could've shaved your peach hairs.\"
\"I… I could go and shave.\"
\"It's fine. You suit it.\"
She flashes a wink and giggles.
\"Thanks...\"
\"You look nice, too.\"
She brushes off my comment.
\"We're waiting for Casey and Dean again. I'll ring them.\"
She dials and turns away.
\"Where are you guys?\"
\"Hurry up!\"
\"Alright, we'll meet you there then.\"
She slides her phone into her bag and turns back to me.
\"We'd better get there early!\"
\"Where are we going?\"
She whispers in my ear.
\"You'll see.\"
She claps her hands and sets off.
The city glows with a vibrant tint. The sun departs, leaving maroon in its wake.
A mixture of pleasant fragrances ride on the breeze, foods from the restaurants and perfumes of passing people.
The streets sing with the buzz of chatter and laughter as groups of people pull off into the bars and restaurants.
Then it hits me... we're dressed like these people.
Wait, are we—
\"Peter!\"
An impatient Jennifer snaps me back into reality.
\"Huh?\"
\"Did you bring your ID?\"
\"Oh, yeah...\"
As I retrieve it from my pocket she snatches it from my fingers.
\"Lemme see!\"
I reach out to grab it but she turns, and opens it to my picture.
\"No way is that you!\"
I sigh in defeat.
\"Yeah.\"
\"Look how long your hair was!\"
\"You look like a different person...\"
I was...
\"...Yeah.\"
She peers closer into my passport and turns to me in confusion.
“I thought nineteen was a typo in class…\"
I have to change the subject and I have to know.
\"Did you ask my age because we're going to a bar?\"
She grins as we stop outside a restaurant.
“Don’t be silly. How easy do you think I am?\"
Easy enough to get to a restaurant, apparently.
Or am I that easy...?
I shrug off trivialities and follow.
The buzz from outside follows, but music drowns the din of chatter.
The rich aromas of tomato, cheese, and herbs hit like a wall.
She parks her bag at a table of two and sits down.
“Uh, weren't we supposed to save seats for them?\"
\"They're going to a different restaurant.\"
\"Why?\"
\"I’ve already been through this!\"
\"Dean and Casey?\"
\"Yeah!\"
\"So you set up events and—\"
A waiter approaches and places our menus.
\"Good evening.\"
An Italian twang lilts his accent.
\"Welcome to Isabella Italia.\"
We give thanks.
“I’ll be back soon to take your orders. Don’t hesitate to hail a waiter in the meantime.\"
He glides off back into the field of tables.
\"What ya gettin’?\"
I open the menu and find myself drowning in choice.
“I don’t know...\"
Everything's so expensive... not like I have much else to spend the money on.
\"Isabella's amazing. The lasagna here is divine.\"
\"Sounds good.\"
Jennifer signals a waiter.
“Can I take your order?\"
“I’ll have a lasagna, please.”
\"And you, signorina?\"
A grin slides up her cheek.
“I’ll take the carbonara.\"
\"Certainly.\"
He writes our orders and bows.
\"Grazie.\"
He gathers our menus and retreats.
“I thought lasagna was the best.\"
“I can always have some of yours.\"
As she flashes a wink, her phone vibrates.
\"Hey!\"
\"We're at Isabella's.\"
\"But Peter wanted lasagna!\"
\"Why are you telling her I—\"
She presses her finger to her lips and narrows her brow.
\"This place is packed and we've already ordered.\"
I look around to find no table free.
“Isabella always works Saturday, so it’s busy.\"
“You guys took too long!\"
“We weren’t that early.\"
“I’ll see you tomorrow. Bye~!\"
I patiently await the end of the call.
\"You didn't have to throw me under the bus; I barely know them.\"
\"It's fine! They won't hold a grudge against you.\"
A waiter places our dishes; the smell makes my mouth water.
\"Enjoy.\"
As I'm cutting some lasagna into manageable slices, she reaches over and forks a piece.
“I didn't think you were serious!\"
“I want some of yours.\"
I reach over and she deflects me with her fork. 
\"Mine!\"
I lunge in again and she jolts the salt shaker at me.
\"You've just been... assalted!\"
I grab the pepper and grind it in her direction.
\"You're getting peppered!
\"Arsehole! You got it down my top.\"
People glare from adjacent tables.
\"S-sorry...\"
I place it down and fork a mouthful of food.
The flavours of beef, melted cheese, and herbs explode in my mouth.
\"Oh, wow. This really is good.\"
\"I did say you wanted lasagna.\"
She flashes a wink and I can only chuckle.
\"You're not wrong.\"
\"I never am!\"
She twists spaghetti, pork, and sauce onto her fork and offers it to me.
\"Oh, wow. The food here is amazing.\"
\"That's why we came!\"
We tuck into our food, but I'm curious.
\"Doesn't Danielle join you?\"
I ask, knowing full well she’d rather spend her Saturdays playing Magnum Dilon.
\"No...\"
Her reluctance arouses my curiosity.
\"You two seemed close when I met you.\"
\"You could say that. We were best friends in primary school.\"
\"And now?\"
A pensive expression washes over her face.
\"We're still friends.\"
I respect her reluctance and drop it; she’s respected mine.
\"So what about you? What about your friends?\"
Which backfires.
\"I... I don't have any.\"
I receive a shove that makes me struggle for balance.
\"What about me?\"
Her lips drop into a pout. I roll my eyes.
\"Of course you are!\"
I can't contain my grin.
The waiter collects our empty plates.
\"Did you enjoy your meal?\"
\"It was excellent. Thank you.\"
\"Perfect, compliments to the chef.\"
He bows.
\"Anything else I can help you with?\"
\"Let's stay and have a drink.\"
The grin on her lips twists.
\"...Alcoholic?\"
\"Yeah! You're old enough, right?\"
\"Err...\"
\"Don't worry, it's on me.\"
The waiter returns and places down our drinks.
I choke back some of the bitter brew.
I take a sip of the beer and fail to manage my grimace.
\"Drink much Peter?\"
\"No...\"
\"Talk much?\"
\"If you ask me a question.\"
\"So, any story to why you're a year older than the rest of us?\"
\"I... was in a car crash...\"
The words slip my lips, but I somehow feel comfortable enough to say it.
\"Is that why you have those scars on your leg?\"
I knew she'd seen them. I can't deny it at this point.
\"Yep.\"
\"What was it like having a year off?\"
\"...Awful.\"
\"Well, you're here now.\"
She laughs and claps my shoulder.
\"Yeah...\"
The word escapes with a smile.
She raises her glass and nods at my own.
\"To the swimming team.\"
To a new life.
We clink our glasses together and finish our drinks.
\"We should head back, it's getting late.\"
I check my phone to see it's 10pm. Damn, didn't realise how late it was.
We hail a waiter and pay our bill.
The night's cool air a pleasant welcome. Flutters in my stomach evoke a warm flush up to my cheeks.
I can't be sure whether it was that drink or this girl beside me.
Jennifer bombards me with her plans for swimming.
\"Wait, extra practise?\"
\"Yeah! We need to get this right!\"
I can't help wonder why she's carefree enough to have a drink with such aspirations.
\"OK, sure.\"
Her mouth opens and her features lighten in realisation.
\"Really?\"
\"Yeah.\"
\"Thanks, Peter!\"
She latches me in a brief hug.
\"You're the best!\"
I can only smile and shrug.
\"How about Monday morning?\"
I didn't expect something so soon... but at least it's not tomorrow morning.
\"Sure.\"
I'm left echoing her smile.
\"Well, you'd better get yourself an early night for Monday.\"
\"But thanks, Peter. I had fun tonight.\"
\"Yeah, me too. I will do.\"
\"Goodnight.\"
\"Goodnight, Jennifer.\"
I head to my room with a grin perched on my lips.
It doesn't matter who I was; I have a new life ahead of me.
I wake up with last night fresh in my mind.
What's she doing today?
I could message her...
\"Hey Jennifer, wanna do something?\"
I hold down backspace and watch the characters dissapear.
I stare into the screen until it locks black.
She did say she was going to see Casey today...
I waste my energy pacing my room, doing nothing productive. You could almost say nothing's changed.
Why did she invite me out yesterday?
Was it just for her plans to get Casey and Dean to spend time together?
My stomach sinks and I flop back onto my bed.
I'm getting myself way too worked up.
...Speak of the devil.
\"What's your room number?!\"
Hello to you too.
\"It's one-one-seven.\"
“I'll be there in a minute!\"
\"Wait—\"
Dammit, she's hung up.
Shit, my room's a mess.
I kick my dirty clothes under the bed and stack up my used plates.
Despite the mess, it looks so bare...
I take my pots to the kitchen and opt to wait outside to intercept her.
\"Hey! Why ya waiting for me here?\"
\"I just thought it’d be easier...\"
\"Oh?\"
\"Your room's not a mess?\"
\"Erm... no?\"
My denial comes out like a question.
\"Liar! Let's go!\"
I cut my losses and follow.
She jumps on the back of the trolley and thrusts her finger towards the meat aisle.
\"Onward!\"
Her roar draws the attention of the people who hadn't noticed yet.
\"Stop!\"
I lower my head to hide my burning cheeks. Her grin only widens.
\"This is no time to be embarrassed, brave knight!\"
Why did I open my mouth?
\"Brave knight?\"
\"Y'know, like those fantasy games. Danielle was obsessed with them!\"
I can see why she's now hiding the fact.
\"...What are we getting?\"
\"You don't know?!\"
\"We're on a quest to save chickety!\"
\"I'll take it we're getting chicken.\"
\"Chickety!\"
I shut my mouth and follow.
How have I ended up paying for chickety?
Chicken! This girl...
\"Are you positive you don't require lessons from a master chef such as myself?\"
Her arrogance draws the smile on my lips.
\"I'm certain I'll survive, chef.\"
With you cooking it.
\"Suit yourself.\"
But I find myself intrigued as she sprinkles various spices into the bowl of chicken by eye, followed by a drizzle of olive oil and lemon juice.
She caresses the spices into the meat and wraps a sheet of cling film over the top.
She catches me staring when she turns, drawing the smug smile on her lips.
\"Keep me entertained.\"
\"Huh?\"
\"We've gotta wait a few hours for the marinade to set into the meat.\"
\"Well, I'll tell you about all of the things I could've eaten in that time.\"
I'm met by a glare.
\"For starters, I'd already be tucking into a ham and cheese sandwich.\"
\"How about I don't give you any?\"
\"Hey, I paid for chickety!\"
\"I'm claiming him with spice!\"
She lifts the clingfilm and suspends the open container of chilli powder over the bowl.
\"You wouldn't dare.\"
Her features turn devilish.
\"Would I not?\"
She jolts the container; a small puff of powder descends over the bowl.
\"OK, OK. Please, just don't hurt Chickety!\"
My simulated plea extracts a laugh from her.
\"You're so dramatic!\"
\"Says you...\"
She meets me with a smug smile.
...
\"Why does it takes so long?\"
\"Yeah... Danielle always tells me to pre-prepare.\"
\"It's fine after a couple of hours, but it's recommended to leave it overnight.\"
My interest is piqued by the aroma searing from the pan.
I approach, trying to get a better view.
\"See, not as boring as you made it out to be.\"
Her face turns to mine, mere inches away.
I jump back startled. My reaction met by a wink.
\"No need to be shy; the only thing I'll be eating is this chicken.\"
My thought pattern sends a warm flush creeping up my cheeks. Which only draws another laugh.
\"Make yourself useful. You could dry the dishes with the heat in your cheeks.\"
I resign myself to cleaning the plates I left out earlier.
She serves them up on my freshly washed plates. I swallow my saliva several times during the process.
\"Bon Appétit.\"
She raises her wrap, we touch wraps and take a bite.
The well-cooked chicken, salad, and spices blend explode into perfection.
\"Not gon' lie, this'ish really good.\"
\"Pfft. What'd you expect?\"
Though she boasts with a wave of her palm, there's a gleam in her grin.
I find it contagious as I realise her passion for food.
I stretch, releasing a yawn.
\"Moon's still out. Great start to the day.\"
My tone loaded with sarcasm.
\"I'm not going in the morning.\"
She imitates me in her high-pitched voice. I can only grimace.
\"I'll go back to bed then.\"
I turn back and she latches herself around my arm.
\"You wouldn't just leave me like that!\"
Not normally, but don't push me right now.
I sigh and allow her to lead me to the poolside.
At least her warmth and willingness to keep me around isn't unpleasant.
\"Let's have a race!\"
Her personality on the other hand...
\"Ugh, it's first thing in the morning.\"
\"C'mon!\"
I'm already regretting this.
\"You'll obviously win.\"
\"But how else will you stay fit?\"
\"I thought I just had to lift you a few times.\"
\"What are you trying to say?\"
I can't help grin.
\"I need weight training to lift you, not a race.\"
She digs my arm and growls.
\"Alright, alright.\"
Her smile returns as I line myself up by the side of the pool.
Her hands slam into my back.
\"You…\"
The word seethes from my lips. I mange to subdue profanities.
\"Ahahahaha!\"
I splash water at her and she only laughs harder.
\"You’re... cute when... you’re angry.\"
Laughter interspersed between her words.
I climb out and she jumps into the pool.
She's done me again...
I cannonball into the water beside her and rush to the surface with a smile.
\"Why would I care? I'm already wet.\"
Her innuendo delivered with a wink.
I resign to practice and vow to get her back...
We're a little late but the coach just ushers us to get started.
Jennifer turns to face me with her back to the pool.
\"C'mon! We're already late.\"
Now’s my chance!
\"Gotcha!\"
\"Peter!\"
Shit…
\"Do you understand how dangerous that is?\"
He lectures me about health and safety…
\"I’m sorry, Sir. It won’t happen again.\"
\"Good.\"
Even after that whole lecture, all I can think is worth it.
Jennifer motions me over with a scowl, luckily she's more interested in the lesson than revenge.
\"Peter!\"
Jennifer approaches as I'm about to climb out. Casey just behind her.
\"Casey!\"
\"Good work today, guys.\"
We share a glance. Jennifer looked ready to tell me something.
\"It was.\"
\"Have you convinced Dean to join yet?\"
\"No... I'm doing fine with Matthew.\"
She focuses on her hand trailing through the water.
\"I don't think he'd ever join anyway...\"
Her voice sinks into an indescernible mumble.
\"Don't say that! You just need to pester him!\"
Casey shrugs.
\"It worked on Peter.\"
\"Hey! I joined from my own volition, thanks.\"
\"Vol—?\"
\"From my own free will!\"
\"But I planted the seed!\"
The whole thing just gives me mixed feelings.
I enoy spending time with Jennifer, but it only seems to confirm my doubt when she says something like that.
\"Let's get changed!\"
Casey leads them into the girl's changing rooms. Jennifer points to her eye, to me, and then to her wrist before following.
I decipher it as, see you later!
As the kettle clicks, banging in the hallway draws me to the doorway.
\"Jennifer?\"
She forces me back into the kitchen.
\"Good timing! You even boiled the kettle!\"
\"How many sugars?\"
\"None, I'm sweet enough.\"
She flashes a wink.
\"But seriously?\"
\"Hey, I'm serious! No sugars.\"
I grin as I place her brew beside her.
\"Oh.\"
I stretch my aching arms and take a sip of my own.
\"Y'know, it shouldn't hurt to drink a cup of tea.\"
\"I'm a good weight, I see.\"
She invites herself in.
Her eyes scan across my room.
It makes me feel self-conscious about it still being bare in nature.
And the fact my clothes are still peeking from under my bed from the other day...
\"So this is your room?\"
\"Yep.\"
\"Ready to leave so soon?\"
\"Nope...\"
She opens my wardrobe to my chagrin.
\"Hey!\"
\"You haven't even unpacked your suitcase?!\"
I shut the door and usher her away.
\"It's fine, I'll sort it out later.\"
\"You've been here for three weeks!\"
\"Then another day won't matter.\"
\"I know you're not going to do it tomorrow.\"
\"It's fine the way it is, just leave it.\"
\"I've already seen it now. I can't let it go...\"
Her pout wins out in the end.
\"Fine...\"
As I'm hanging up my T-shirts, she starts packing away my underwear.
\"Stop! What are you doing?\"
\"It's washed, right?\"
\"Yeah, of course. It's just weird!\"
\"How would you feel if I came into your room and started packing away your underwear?\"
She bursts into laughter.
\"Wouldn't happen. They'd be where they should be.\"
\"If I caught you snooping through my drawers on the otherhand...\"
\"Wouldn't happen. What do you take me for?\"
To my surprise, a pensive expression washes over her face.
\"Y'know, I'm not sure with you sometimes. You're not a perv, though.\"
It takes a moment to reaise its not an insult.
\"Good. Do my T-shirts instead.\"
I usher her to where I left off on my T-shirts.
\"Why did you come anyway?\"
\"I almost forgot! We need to plan Casey's Birthday!\"
\"I'm not good at planning.\"
\"I can see that.\"
...
\"When is it?\"
\"It's on Thursday, but we can plan something for the weekend.\"
\"Why the weekend?\"
\"It's her eighteenth birthday. So she'll legally be able to drink.\"
\"You want us to go and get drunk?\"
\"No, I want Dean and Casey to have a few drinks together.\"
\"Then what do you want me to do?\"
\"You to ring me and pretend you're lost. I'll meet you near Stop-Shop and we'll leave them to get together.\"
\"Then what are we going to do?\"
\"I thought we could get some grilled chicken from Pepper's. It's amazing~!\"
I release a grin and shrug. How can I say no?
\"Sounds good.\"
\"Then it's settled!\"
She lays down my T-shirt mid-sentence and rises.
\"You can't just leave this half done. You started it!\"
\"I've given you a head start. I'm sure you can handle the rest.\"
She offers an exaggerated grin as she leaves.
\"Ba-bye~!\"
...
It's the kick up the arse I needed, but I still can't help but feel annoyed.
I rang Jennifer ten minutes ago. What's taking her so long?
I whip out my phone and begin a message.
\"Peter!\"
Finally.
\"What's up? You've got a face like a slapped arse.\"
She pinches my cheek and I push her hand away.
\"You took ages and I haven't eaten yet.\"
\"Pepper's will be worth it!\"
She tugs on my sleeve and I follow.
As we pull out onto Long Rd, Dean and Casey are waiting.
Surely they've followed her...
\"Hey, guys. Where are you going?\"
Casey's expression insinuates she knows the ruse.
\"Hey, we were gonna get some food on the way.\"
\"Don't you usually do that at the end of the night?\"
\"Always good to prepare for the night.\"
Dean approaches me.
\"Plannin' t' leave?\"
I'll just have to roll with it.
\"Oh, nah. Still new around here and haven't eaten yet.\"
He snorts and smiles.
\"Whatever. Let's get a drink.\"
\"Catch up, ladies.\"
They pay no notice and I head off with Dean.
\"Gettin' along alright with Jenny, aren't ya?\"
\"Jenny?\"
\"Yeah. She hates that nickname.\"
I take a mental note to store it in my arsenal.
\"So you're helpin' her out with the team?\"
\"Yeah. She's helped me with the move and... meeting people.\"
A gasp escapes my lips as his hand crashes into my back.
\"It's just here.\"
The smell of alcohol and perfume sit on the air. It reminds me of my uncle.
He pulls up a chair at the bar and I sit beside him.
\"Two Burgs.\"
\"You lads got ID?\"
Somehow, I knew I'd need it tonight.
We show our IDs and he pulls our pints.
\"Cheers.\"
He holds up his glass and I meet it with mine.
\"Cheers.\"
I struggle to contain my grimace after we drink.
\"She growin' on ya?\"
I shrug.
\"Yeah, I guess.\"
\"She's a good'n.\"
His eyes rest on his drink and his lips fall flat.
A meaty hand slams on Dean's shoulder.
\"Ryan! How's it goin'?\"
He ignores Dean's question and scans me head-to-toe with a stern gaze.
\"Ryan.\"
He offers a shake and crushes my hand.
\"Peter.\"
\"Good t' meet ya.\"
\"You too.\"
He loses interest and focuses back on Dean.
\"Why you stopped weight liftin'? It's borin' without ya.\"
\"I don't have time. I'm two As away from a scholarship.\"
Damn, I didn't pin Dean down to have such good grades.
\"Don't have time? You're in a bar.\"
\"It's Casey's birthday.\"
\"You gon' get with her or what?\"
He shoots a glance at me.
\"We're friends.\"
\"I need to get back to Amber, anyway. Later.\"
\"Later.\"
\"Don't be getting yourself expelled.\"
Ryan grins and walks away.
Dean leans towards me.
\"He's a cool guy, but—\"
He scans for Ryan to be sure he's out of earshot.
\"—I wouldn't want to get on the wrong side of him. Just stay away from his sister, Rachel.\"
\"I don't even know wh—\"
\"Dean! Peter!\"
We opt to find a table.
We make our way to the last free table and Jennifer heads for the bar; Dean’s eyes follow.
\"Need a hand?\"
\"Sure.\"
They make their way to the bar with our eyes in tow.
Dean leans his mouth into her ear; Jennifer laughs and slaps his arm.
It stirs up discomfort. I enjoy her playful nature, but... she's like this with everyone?
\"You like Jennifer, don't you.\"
My mouth opens but my brain freezes.
\"It's OK, I won't tell her.\"
She looks in their direction but her eyes fall to the table.
\"She won't notice anyway.\"
Venom laces her tone.
\"What do you mean?\"
\"Before you came, she'd bail from outings with personal issues, and now she's going out with you instead.\"
\"Every time she sets up events, it always ends up being me with Dean.\"
\"And everytime I think we're getting somewhere, I have to watch his eyes light up when he sees her again...\"
The wry smile twisting her lips twists my heart.
\"So I'd appreciate it if you told Jennifer to stop setting up time for us to be alone.\"
\"Why haven't you told her?\"
\"Because... if I told her my feelings, she'd only persist more.\"
\"She does know...\"
\"I know...\"
\"I just question whether she knows Dean likes her.\"
Her smile returns as they do.
Jennifer places a small glass in each of our places.
\"Shots!\"
I sip back my beer.
\"I've still got this beer.\"
Dean places down another drink in each place and takes his seat.
\"Drink much, Peter?\"
My first pint is barely halfway and they've finished their drinks.
\"Can't say I do...\"
Jennifer lifts her shot glass.
\"Casey's eighteenth!\"
We all gives cheers tilt our shots back. The taste of chemicals fills my mouth as the liquid burns down my throat.
They share a laugh as my face contorts and I fail to contain a cough.
\"So, Dean, aren't you going to swim with Casey?\"
Dean takes a glace at Casey and sighs.
\"I've got a lot on my plate right now.\"
\"But the team evaluation is soon!\"
Casey stares into her empty shot glass.
\"He has a lot on his plate.\"
She reiterates his words in a flat tone.
I take a sip of my beer just to feel like I belong here.
\"We should do more shots!\"
\"No, thank you.\"
Casey rises.
\"We've got a table booked at Isabella's.\"
She casts her gaze on Dean who looks perplexed.
\"It's packed tonight.\"
\"Oh, yeah.\"
Casey necks back her cocktail.
\"We should go, it's almost half-seven.\"
Dean downs his own drink and follows.
\"Later.\"
As they exit, Jennifer sighs and rests her face in her palms.
\"Should we see if there are any free tables?\"
\"They're not going to Isabella's...\"
\"They know?\"
\"Yeah.\"
...
\"Do you know Dean doesn't like her?\"
\"He hasn't given her a chance...\"
I don't have it in me to bring up that he likes her...
It's something I rather wouldn't accept.
\"So why are you pushing it?\"
\"I thought we could be teams together; I thought we'd be a group of friends.\"
\"But I keep... fucking that up.\"
\"I'm getting a drink.\"
\"I'll get one, too. As long as it's not another shot.\"
Her solemnity gone as quickly as it appeared.
\"You're a wuss. What'dya want, a cocktail?\"
Her tone filled with sarcasm but I'm curious.
\"Sure, they look pretty good.\"
She wriggles into the crowd by the bar and manages to get served before most.
Soon appearing with two cocktails.
\"You'll like this one!\"
She passes me the cocktail as we make our way back, and we take our seats.
\"What is it?\"
\"Sex on the Beach!\"
\"I think we're living in the wrong country for that.\"
\"We? I didn't say it'd be with you.\"
She winks and slaps my arm.
\"Uh...\"
Heat rises into my cheeks.
\"It's too easy! Had to get you back for pushing me in the pool.\"
\"You pushed me in first!\"
She laughs and waves it away.
\"Thanks for joining me. I do appreciate it y'know.\"
I shrug and release a bashful smile.
\"What did you mean before, about the team evaluation?\"
\"Five teams are chosen but only one couple will be picked to compete against other schools.\"
\"Then the winners then get a chance to complete at a semi-professional level...\"
\"I'll train with you in the mornings.\"
My tongue loose from the alcohol. To see her smile now is worth my future effort.
\"Make it official.\"
We clink glasses and latch our pinkies.
\"To the Olympics.\"
We neck back our drinks.
\"Is that what you want?\"
\"Me? I'm not sure what I want—\"
I carry on as her brow tilts.
\"—Eating would be nice, though.\"
She snatches her phone from her bag.
\"Pepper's is still open, hurry!\"
She finishes her drink and I follow suit.
Jennifer brings our orders back to the table.
She holds out a fast food container, flourishing her free hand above it as though casting a spell.
\"Jennifer! She's brought to you by...\"
Her high-pitched commentary is synchronised with the revelation of its contents.
\"Pepper's Mediterranean Grill.\"
She disects the burger with great care, noting each ingredient with her pinky.
\"A freshly cooked chicken fillet, coated in a home-made Mediterranean marinade—accompanied by fresh red onion, lettuce, tomato, and mayonnaise, on a perfectly grilled bun.\"
She points to the bag she placed on the table.
\"Along with a side of fries and a drink. All for just four ninety-five!\"
She tilts back her head, bringing the burger to her lips.
I can't contain my laughter as mayonnaise rolls down her chin.
\"What're you laughin' at?\"
\"At least you could apply for a role in an advert if you don't make it in the Olympics.\"
Or a porno.
She wipes her chin and glares!
\"Arsehole! Now you have to make sure we make it!\"
\"I'll do my best.\"
She smiles and nods.
\"Now eat up! It's really good.\"
\"I won't lie, they were almost as good as your wraps.\"
\"Almost?\"
\"Y'know, I might just have to try them again to clarify.\"
She smirks and winks.
\"You just might.\"
\"My dorms are on the other side from yours.\"
She wraps me in a hug.
\"Thanks, Peter. I needed this tonight.\"
Me too.
I allow myself to wrap my arms around her and feel solace for a brief moment before she lets go.
\"What about Dean and Casey?\"
\"I'll leave it to them.\"
Casey's words echo through my mind.
\"I think that's probably best.\"
\"Goodnight, Peter.\"
\"'Night.\"
Why did she hug me? I can almost feel her warmth as it flashes back through my mind.
Can we really make it?
No.
At least not me. I flop back onto my bed.
If she makes it without me, would she leave me behind?
Even if she didn't, I'd only hold her back.
She should have someone like Dean... atheletic, smart, motivated...
Are we just holding Jennifer and Dean back...?
All those nights I've spent alone, wondering what it was to have a friend.
And now here I am, being selfish, wondering if I'll lose her because of what she wants.
I sit up and rest my head in my palms.
I'm still... paralysed by my own venom.
I will make sure she makes these trials.
...Maybe I'll make it too.
My early alarm stirs regret in my stomach.
Today's the day where the teams are picked.
Nervousness is wedged in my stomach.
We've trained every day for two weeks, but it just doesn't feel enough.
\"Hey.\"
I greet her nonchalantly, but a smile conquers my lips just at the sight of her.
\"Peter!\"
Jennifer wraps me in her arms; I stiffen before reciprocating.
\"Err?\"
Is the only response my brain can muster.
\"Am I not allowed to hug my friend?\"
\"Of course.\"
\"I haven't even been able to sleep...\"
\"You've got to be ready for everyday!\"
I imitate her hyperbole, grateful to hear a chuckle from her.
\"Arsehole!\"
\"We've done everything we can do now. I know you'll make it.\"
We huddle around the instructor, who begins naming the candidates; Jennifer's fingers dig into my forearm.
\"Casey, Claire, Matthew, Marcus, Jennifer...\"
She wraps me in a hug.
\"We did it!\"
As he finishes with names, my heart drops at the lack of my own.
\"You did it...\"
\"Thank you so much...\"
It's not something I wanted to do, but I wanted to go with her.
But as long as she's happy...
\"Good luck this weekend.\"
\"I won't let you down, I promise!\"
I feel deflated after failing to make it. It was naive to think I could...
Sleep doesnt come easy...
The darkness shifts into a wooden ceiling. This shack...
I crawl towards her and she looks toward the pans on the stove.
Dinner will be ready soon.
She calls me toward her, rattling a toy.
As I near her, she lays it down and exits.
Don't leave me alone.
The doors and windows merge into wooden panels.
I'm trapped.
I wake up in a cold sweat.
What have I lost...?
What was my life like... before?
What was it like to feel... loved...
My anxiety peaks again but for different reasons.
The thoughts of Jennifer slipping from my grasp...
The thoughts that I'm only holding her back...
Will I lose Jennifer too?
The trials are today. And all I can do is contemplate my selfishness.
She told me to meet her at that bar at 6pm.
Whether win or lose, she would need a drink. I think I do, too.
I arrive and smile when I see her.
\"Celebrating?\"
She necks back her cocktail and orders another.
\"Jennifer?\"
She pours another down her throat.
\"Woooooo~!\"
\"Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die!\"
\"That's...\"
\"—From the Bible!\"
\"Just because it's...\"
\"—ah, fuck it. Get me a drink.\"
She hands me a drink and is about to neck back another. I block her with my hand.
\"Calm down, we've got class tomorrow.\"
\"I didn't make it...\"
Her confession comes with a sigh.
I could already tell from the scene.
As low as I feel seeing her like this, there's a part of me that's glad she didn't make it without me.
\"What about the other competitions?\"
\"What's the point?\"
...
\"How many have you had?\"
\"Just two.\"
She finishes her drink and I follow suit.
\"Another for both of us.\"
The barman prepares our drinks and slides them over.
\"Are you OK?\"
\"Do I look like I'm OK?!\"
\"Sorry...\"
She take a deep breath and sighs.
\"No, I'm sorry. I don't mean to take it out on you.\"
\"Wanna finish our drinks and go somewhere?\"
\"Like where?\"
\"There's a park nearby!\"
\"If you want.\"
\"We can get some Alisay on the way.\"
\"I'm down.\"
As long as it's with you.
We park ourselves on a bench and open our bottles; Jennifer got cherry and I got blueberry.
\"Cheers.\"
She holds her bottle up and I meet it with mine.
\"Cheers.\"
We both guzzle from our bottles.
\"Oh, that's pretty good.\"
She ignores me.
\"May your glass be ever full. May the roof over your head be always strong.~\"
\"And may you be in heaven half an hour before the devil knows you're dead.~\"
She delivers it with a sense of longing.
\"What's that?\"
\"It's an Irish blessing! Now drink.\"
I abide and drink with her.
\"Are you Irish?\"
\"My father's Irish, my mother was Indian.\"
\"...Was?\"
\"Oh, she's not dead. I just never see her.\"
She pulls her phone from her bag and stares into it.
\"She was supposed to be there...\"
\"But I don't care anymore, she might as well be dead.\"
It irks me that she'd discard her mother like that...
\"Y'know... there'd never be a chance to see her again if she was dead.\"
\"I don't know her. My dad's ex has been more of a mother than she ever has.\"
\"...\"
She takes a deep drink fom her bottle.\"
\"It's just something else I fucked up.\"
It's unnerving to hear her say something like that.
\"What do you mean?\"
\"My relationships never seem to last, friends or family.\"
\"Your friends?\"
\"Dean and Casey must hate me for my antics—Danielle already does.\"
\"Danielle?\"
\"When I found out she was making a fantasy game, I made fun of her.\"
She chuckles to herself.
\"She hated it in public, so it just made me do it more...\"
A tear meets her wry smile.
They seemed so close in class, but that tear a symbol of how far they've drifted.
\"I miss her... I miss the times we shared growing up.\"
Her wistful words stab my heart. I don't want to be lonely, either.
I place my arm around her shoulder. She leans into my side; her warmth flowing into my chest.
\"What about you, Peter? You never mention your past.\"
My past? I struggle to define what that is. I take a swig from my bottle.
\"...I never had one.\"
I blurt out my usual self-hatred.
\"You never had one?!\"
\"It's... complicated...\"
She wipes her eyes and sniffles.
\"Like, you never grew up playing with friends?\"
\"Not... really.\"
I never grew up.
\"We're gonna play a game!\"
\"What...?\"
\"Hide-and-seek!\"
\"I don't think now's the best time to play. It's dark, who knows who's about?\"
\"Close your eyes!\"
She strokes my eye-lids shut with her fingers, whispering in my ear.
\"If you find me, you'll get a surprise.\"
Her breathe raises the hairs on my neck.
\"Fine.\"
\"Count to twenty. Don't peek!\"
\"One...\"
Her soft steps leave me alone...
...
\"...Twenty.\"
I rise and scan the area. Empty.
I follow the sound of her footsteps.
Shadows dance in the bushes; I move the leaves aside to reveal darkness.
The leaves rustling in the wind kill the little chance I had of hearing her.
\"Jennifer?\"
No answer...
How far could she have gone in twenty seconds?
It's been ten minutes and I still can't find her.
Something's happened.
The thought extracts a pang of anxiety in my chest.
I knew this was a bad idea.
I pull out my phone and ring her...
Her ring tone calls out behind me as the call ends.
\"Did you think you'd lost me?\"
Her grin annoys me.
\"No!\"
But relief extinguishes it.
\"Would you miss me if you couldn't find me?\"
She presses herself against me, meeting my eyes with a grin.
\"I... I'd never forget you.\"
\"Close your eyes.\"
The breath from her whisper tickles my nose.
Her fingers brush over my eyelids.
\"Jenni—\"
Her lips cut me off.
Her tongue bursts through my lips with the taste of cherry.
Our lips part, leaving me breathless.
My eyes open to her grin.
My chest feels light, like a burden was lifted from my shoulders.
Jennifer closes my open jaw.
\"Let's go back to the bar.\"
\"Don't you think we've drank enough?\"
\"Stop being boring, c'mon!\"
\"I don't think it's a—\"
Her lips cut me off again.
And just like that, I'm grounded by her hand tugging my sleeve.
\"Let's go!\"
And my resistence is left a token.
We neck back the remainder of our bottles and put them in a bin on the way out.
A wave of euphoria washes over me. I feel on top of the world.
I look to Jennifer, who returns a grin.
\"Drunk, Peter?\"
\"I think so... Aren't you?\"
\"A little.\"
\"Is that why you just...?\"
\"Don't think about it so much. Just have a good time!\"
If feel more at ease this time around. It's OK to let loose sometimes, right?
My thoughts are stopped by the bouncer asking to check our IDs.
I notice the change in atmosphere as we enter; the music has changed in both genre and volume, the tables are filled with bubbling patrons, and there's a space cleared for a small dance floor, which nobody is using.
We manage to find a table of two with seats in the crowded atmosphere.
\"You ever had a tequila slammer?\"
\"Can't say I have...\"
\"Save my seat.\"
She strides for the bar, my eyes and thoughts in tow.
She kissed me...
Just the thought makes my heart leap again.
There's just something so adventurous about her. I can't help but be attracted to it.
It's like I've just recognised how much I appreciate her storming into my life with hindsight. I'd just be alone, rotting in my thoughts without her...
And just the thought of something more between us...
A group of men laughing on the table beside breaks me from my reverie.
The anxiety being alone in a crowded bar with nothing to keep me occupied reminds me this probably wasn't a good idea.
But to see Jennifer shimmying through the crowd with an assortment of salt, shots, and sliced lime is a relief.
\"Ready?\"
She places the tray on the table and the relief is short lived.
\"What's this?\"
She places salt on her hand, and grabs the shot with the other.
\"Salt, shot, then you suck the lime.\"
\"Ready?\"
Not really... I ready some salt on my hand and nod.
We give cheers and perform our ritual.
The salt and lime actually manage to make it bearable. 
Jennifer pulls the neck of my top and peers inside.
\"Finally grown a few chest hairs?\"
I shake off the alcohol burning down my throat and release my pride.
\"Let's get another.\"
\"It's already on its way.\"
Her eyes rest on the approaching waiter, who places down another round of slammers and cocktails.
Fuck. I'm not ready for another so soon.
\"I can't afford to pay for so many drinks.\"
\"Don't worry! It's on me.\"
It's alright to let loose sometimes, right? I mock myself.
As alchol rushes over my senses, I lose the constant feeling of anxiety I'd gotten used to.
Everything will be OK. Somehow, I believe it.
I sprawl over the table and catch my temple in my palm.
As I look at Jennifer, an urge rises in me to kiss her again.
\"You OK, Peter? Had too much?\"
\"I'm fine.\"
\"I just don't know what I'd be doing without you.\"
She shoves me and I sway back.
\"You'd probably do better without me.\"
Jennifer's answer rolls off like water from a duck's back.
\"If I hadn't met you, I—\"
\"Let's do another slammer!\"
\"Put your hands on my hips.\"
\"Don't act so awkward, you've lifted me by my butt before.\"
She delivers it with a wink.
I loosen up and she wraps her arms over my shoulders.
\"We'll make a dancer of you yet.\"
\"I might just enjoy it, yet.\"
I flow with Jennifer's movements, each movement stimulating. I want to put my hands on her rear but I fear a reaction, either from her, or myself.
My hands move towards her rear naturally as her hips sway.
She peeks around the corner to see if a guard is stationed at the front gate.
She stumbles back and slants her finger across her lips.
\"Shh!\"
\"I wasn't... speaking.\"
\"We're gonna have to climb over the wall.\"
She pushes my butt up as I pull myself up.
\"Shouldn't you go first?\"
\"But you have t' catch me on the other side.\"
My brain thumping against my skull stirs me into consciousness.
I beg for sleep to return but my bladder protests.
My arm is numb; I try to lift it and it slumps over the side of my bed.
Realising I'm so close to the edge I roll back onto something warm and soft...
Jennifer!
I lift her arm off of me and slide out of bed, catching myself on my desk.
What the hell happened last night?
\"Jennifer?\"
...
\"Jennifer?\"
I poke her arm and she stirs.
\"Mmmmm.\"
\"Jennifer?\"
I shake her arm and she snatches it away.
\"Mmmmmmmmmm!\"
\"Jennifer?\"
\"Fuck off.\"
\"You're in my room... \"
She snuggles into the quilts and ignores me.
I can't help but take note of her bare leg poking from from under the sheets, and her stockings, skirt, and shirt scattered across the floor...
I put my shorts and a T-shirt on and head to the bathroom.
After appeasing nature, I measure myself in the mirror.
Did we do it?
What if she's... pregnant?
I forgot everything...
I watch the colour drain from my cheeks.
My stomach churns, and salivia fills my mouth.
I'm gonna throw up.
I hug the toilet and hurl into the bowl.
My head is in pieces.
I need to get it together.
I down a glass of water, but it glides over my cotton mouth.
I pour another for myself and one for Jennifer.
She's sprawled across the bed with her eyes closed. Her chest riding on her breath is the only sign of life.
It's pleasant to see Jennifer so peaceful.
It gives me a moment of calm to approach her.
\"Jennifer?\"
...
I shake her shoulder.
\"I got you a glass of water.\"
She stretches and rubs her eyes.
\"I feel fragile.\"
\"Me too, I'm never drinking again.\"
She bursts into a fit of laughter.
\"That's what they all say.\"
She sits up and snatches the glass from my hand, downing the water in continuous gulps.
\"...You're welcome.\"
\"Thanks, I needed that.\"
\"You told me to fuck off.\"
She giggles.
\"Sorry, I'm tired!\"
\"Morning's nothing. It resides under my boot.\"
I imitate her hyperbole in a high-pitched voice.
\"I'm not wearing my boots.\"
\"That not...\"
I can only laugh after being defeated by such logic.
She begins fumbling under the quilts and looking around the room.
\"Where are my clothes?\"
\"Along the side of the bed, here.\"
She looks at me expectantly.
\"I'll give you some space.\"
I stop playing a game on my phone and check the time again. It's been ten minutes.
I tap on my door.
\"Hey, are you decent?\"
Her voice muffled through the door.
\"Yeah, come in.\"
She's stretching as I enter; although she claims to feel rough, she certainly doesn't look it. She's even managed to sort her hair out in that small amount of time.
\"Damn, can't believe I lost my key again. They're gonna kick up a fuss…\"
\"Regular occurrence?\"
A wry chuckle is her response.
\"Well, kinda...\"
\"They're gonna know I've been drinking.\"
\"You're old enough, right?\"
\"Yeah, it's just frowned upon.\"
She looks guilty for a brief moment before regaining her energy.
\"I know the perfect remedy for a hangover, if you wanna join me after?\"
\"Yeah, sure. Anything to get rid of this.\"
Her tongue brushes over her teeth.
\"And I need to go and brush my teeth and get a shower.\"
\"Yeah, same.\"
\"I'll see you later!\"
\"Later.\"
...
My bed calls me like a gravitational force.
I wrap myself in my sheets.
Her scent makes my heart leap. I can almost feel her warmth against me.
Fuzzy memories of last night resurface. She kissed me.
What does that mean? When I'm to meet her later, how am I supposed to regard her?
As my friend? A lover? A plaything?
The feelings of her lips against mine makes me wish for a happy ending.
I try to plant a kiss on her lips.
\"I told you not to?\"
I manage to kiss her cheek and loll my heavy head.
I tried to kiss her... she rejected me...
Then why'd she kiss me to begin with?
Does she not see me that way?
Who would?
I wring my bed sheets up by my chin.
\"I'm so fucking cringe.\"
What even possessed me to do that?
I'm not sure I'm even ready to face her after that.
It feels worse than this hangover.
I should really go and get that shower...
I throw my towel in the washing pile; I'm surprised Jennifer didn't mention how large it's getting.
I wouldn't have left my room this way if I knew she was staying over.
20 20 hindsight.
I don't know if I can face her... I just hope that she doesn't remember.
I keep thinking to text her and call it off. I don't even know where she wants to go. I don't want people to see me with how bad I feel right now.
My phone's screen lights up suggesting I've missed a call and I take it from my bedside table.
Three missed calls and a message, \"Im on me way!\"
That was five minutes ago—
Jennifer barges into my room before my response.
\"Hey! I could've been naked.\"
\"You're not, you're ready. Let's go!\"
If I had been naked, I get the feeling the only thing that would matter is I wasn't ready in time.
We sit ourselves down at a table.
\"What you gonna get?\"
\"Dunno.\"
\"Don't you know the cure to a hangover?\"
\"No...\"
\"An English breakfast!\"
I nod in satisfaction.
\"Now that does sound good.\"
\"The coffee here is like oil, too.\"
\"That... not so much.\"
\"In a good way; it's probably too strong, but it will keep you fueled on a hangover.\"
I fill my toast with bacon, sausage, and egg, and enjoy as much as my mouth can bite.
I finish my mouthful with satisfaction, and notice Jennifer is shovelling mushrooms on her toast with a fork.
\"Really? You use your toast to eat mushrooms?\"
\"I love mushrooms on toast! And bacon and sausages are so tasty on their own.\"
\"It looks how I feel, like death on toast.\"
\"You don't like mushrooms?!\"
\"Not really. \"
Her fork sweeps up a portion of my mushrooms before I can respond.
\"That will cost you a sausage!\"
I try to reach in but she's on guard.
\"Arsehole! You don't even like 'em.\"
\"You could put them back.\"
\"No.\"
She eats them on her next slice of toast.
It doesn't feel in character to play with her, but I can't help return her playful nature.
\"Look how much you already have! What don't you like?\"
\"I like everything.\"
\"Fine.\"
I tend to my plate until hear the crunch of toast.
At this point, I'm too committed to the role.
\"Hey!\"
Crumbs explode from her lips as I swipe a sausage from her plate and bite into it.
\"This is war!\"
She forks a piece of bacon before I can block her with mine.
\"Not the bacon!\"
I swipe back a piece of hers but the waiter approaches.
\"Can you please calm down. You're disturbing our other patrons.\"
People glare from nearby tables.
I share a glance with Jennifer.
\"I want a sausage back. You don't even like mushrooms!\"
They both glare towards me.
\"Fine.\"
I pull my face as she takes a sausage from my plate.
\"Sorry, sir. We won't cause any more disturbance.\"
\"Sorry.\"
He accepts our apology and resumes a neutral countenance.
\"No problem. Can I get you anything else?\"
Her grin lets me know I'm in trouble.
\"We'll take two Sicilian lemon ciders.\"
\"Certainly.\"
The waiter writers it down and strides to the bar.
\"Sicilian lemon cider? What could go wrong?\"
\"What couldn't go right? Haven't you heard of hair of the dog?\"
\"No.\"
\"The cure is from the hair of the dog that bit you.\"
I shoot a confused brow at her.
\"And?\"
\"If you've got a hangover, another drink is the cure.\"
\"I thought an English breakfast was the cure, and oil coffee?\"
\"This is step three!\"
I had always noticed my uncle would return smelling of alcohol and women's purfume. I'd begun to despise it.
Yet here I am, already about to drink again after telling myself I wouldn't drink again, for a girl.
\"Peter?\"
\"Hm?\"
\"You don't need to drink again if you don't want, y'know?\"
I shrug.
\"It's fine.\"
And my reflexive answer seals my fate.
The waiter reappears right on cue and places down the cloudy yellow liquid.
We follow our ritual of giving cheers and each have a deep drink.
\"Wow. That's actually really good.\"
\"What could go wrong?\"
This goes down way too easy.
Despite how ill I felt this morning. I'm climbing back on top of the world.
\"Jennifer... what happened last night?\"
\"What do you mean?\"
\"I mean... we slept together...\"
\"Don't make it sound like that! I couldn't let you sleep on the floor in your own room...\"
Before my frozen mind can answer, she delivers.
\"You're truthful. Whether you know it or not, it's written on your face.\"
Her assessment leaves me reeling for a retort.
\"I trust you.\"
\"Thanks...\"
How much it means to hear that after last night... and all I can think about is why didn't she kiss me back?
I just don't understand. Could I trust myself enough to make her happy?
I just pray she doesn't remember that part of last night herself. 
She measures me and speaks.
\"I had fun last night. I have fun when I'm with you. So don't worry yourself so much.\"
I couldn't defeat this smile if I tried.
Jennifer Act 2
I put my all day breakfast meal in the microwave. And wait...
And wait...
My phone doesn't provide much distraction as Jennifer still hasn't responded to the text I sent earlier.
I'm not exactly sure--
\"Peter!\"
\"Oh, hey! I texted you earlier.\"
\"Sorry! I've just been so busy this morning.\"
The microwave dings.
\"Oooo, what have you made me? I'm starving!\"
\"You're not having any of this.\"
I pull out the meal and her eyes judge me.
\"Not that I want to. Look at it! It's so processed.\"
\"There's nothing wrong with it.\"
\"That meat is just processed arseholes and eyelids.\"
\"And that sauce! It's artificial tomato sauce with extra salt.\"
\"Fine, it's not that nice. But it sustains me.\"
\"We'll have to teach you how to make something, won't we!\"
\"I'm still eating this.\"
\"Ew.\"
\"Enough judging me, what do you want?\"
\"We need to hang out later! But first I have a few things to take care of.\"
\"You could've just text me y'know?\"
\"That's no fun, I can't bully you then!\"
I poke her in the side, pulling a giggle from her.
\"Oh yeah, ticklish are we?\"
I move in to poke her side again but she swings round and pokes me in mine.
I release a chuckle and lunge in again.
She runs off, her words trail off into the distance.
\"You'll have to get me back later!\"
Damn that girl...
I'm low on a few things, and it might be better to stock up on some spices for when Jennifer comes later.
Processed arseholes and eyelids. I chuckle to myself.
\"What're you smilin' about?\"
I startle to that teacher from the staffroom.
\"Hi, Sir.\"
\"Mr Brent.\"
That's his name.
I have no idea what to say to him. Awkard silence passes...
\"Settling in?\"
\"Yeah, I've made a few friends. I know where the shops are.\"
\"Is that one of your friends?\"
I look over to see Jennifer; Dean pulls her into an embrace and pecks her on the cheek.
\"...Yeah.\"
\"Maybe you should be a bit more discreet next time you scale the wall drunk at two am.\"
My mouth remains open as the realisation sets in.
\"Don't worry. I can overlook it this time. Just be more dicreet if you're going to do this in the future.\"
Relief washes over me.
\"Thank you, sir.\"
I check for Jennifer and Dean but they're gone.
What relationship do they have?
How do I even approach her about it?
\"Why wouldn't you kiss me back the other night? Because you're going off with Dean behind our backs?\"
Casey's words replay in my mind. She likes Dean, but apparently he likes Jennifer.
I don't know what to do.
None of it's made easier by the fact I can still smell her on my sheets...
Thanks for reading! Be sure to check out the other route segments and bad ending.
Please be patient for the credits, there's also a .txt file.
\"I never wanted to...\"
Her lips waver and fall flat.
\"I can't force you...\"
\"Thanks for at least trying it out.\"
She twines her hair around her finger.
\"I'll see you around.\"
\"Bye...\"
I'm left feeling guilty. I shake what could've been from my head and saunter back to my room.
My hand glides to the nape of my neck.
\"I... er... I'll pass.\"
Her lips fall flat and waver in the corners.
\"Hey, that's OK. If it's not your thing then...\"
Her sentence wanes into silence.
She searches through her lush hair and curls it around her fingers.
\"I'll see you around, Peter.\"
She flashes a smile and turns back to her chair.
\"Bye...\"
I'm struck by a pang of guilt.
She looked dejected. I didn't think she'd place so much weight on me coming.
Another day in school, no attention paid. I'm beginning to wonder why I attend.
Jennifer greeted me from afar this morning. It seemed a little strange.
At least she isn't pestering me to swim, it saves me the guilt of saying no again.
But my stomach slumps with the passing thought. I hope I didn't upset her.
But what do I do now? Having too much free time isn't good.
Nothing to distract me...
The mind is the worst enemy when left alone with it for too long. Something I know all too well.
I scan over my room, knowing I won't get shit done.
Inevitably, my mind wanders to my parents... Sarah's picture.
I wonder what Sarah's doing.
She knocked on off her own back to show me that picture. I didn't think she'd acknowledged my question.
I have an urge to knock on her room.
I could knock on her room; she did knock on mine.
I find myself on the corridor, rapping my fist on her door.
The shuffle of footsteps makes me freeze. What do I say?
She had a reason to knock on…
The door creeks open and she peers through the opening. Her eyes widen.
\"Hey.\"
\"Hey… Sarah. What are you doing?\"
\"N-nothing...\"
My brain spins its wheels for something to say.
\"Er… I was wondering… if you wanted to do something?\"
\"Like what?\"
\"I don't know...\"
Blood rushes to my cheeks.
\"…\"
She shimmies back into her room and closes the door.
Did she just reject me?
...
I'm about to turn when her door creeks open again. She emerges with her pad and a set of pencils.
There's an awkward moment of silence as our eyes meet.
\"Er… where are we going?\"
\"The... field? It’s nice today.\"
I crack a smile.
\"Sounds good.\"
Her eyes drop and a smile tugs on her lips. I follow her lead.
The field is empty, we walk into it with no aim so I sit down.
She takes her trainers and socks off and plants herself across from me.
A cool breeze brushes through the grass and meets us. It extracts a satisfying shiver from me.
\"Do you come out here often?\"
\"Sometimes...\"
I can see why, it's secluded from the main grounds.
\"Would you like...?\"
She holds out her spare pad and a piece of paper to rest on it.
\"Thanks.\"
\"What do you want to draw?\"
\"I'll just try to draw the buildings and trees in the background.\"
\"Start with basic outlines. Then…\"
\"Then?\"
\"Well... you should find what works for you. That's just how I'd do it.\"
\"Thanks. I'll give it a try.\"
I spend half an hour rubbing out and redrawing the outline.
And still my trees look like deformed clouds, my buildings look like squares and spikes, and the dirt patch looks like a pond.
I sigh and lie it in front of me.
\"That's not bad. You should start working on the details now.\"
Not bad? It's terrible.
\"...I don't know where to start.\"
She flips to a blank page; I watch in anguish as she sketches an outline better than mine in half the time.
\"Like this...\"
She adds lines and dots that accentuaute each area, windows on buildings, grains of dirt on the patch and branches and foliage on trees.
\"Thanks. I'll give it a try.\"
It looked so easy. I can't get anything right.
I give up on my drawing.
I lie back and sieve blades of grass through my fingers.
Sunlight rests on my skin like a warm blanket, but a wave of grey clouds approach in my peripheral.
It hasn't rained in a while—not since I arrived.
Sarah's scratching and trees sighing leave me lost in thought.
I can feel her presence. My usual thought patterns falter with Sarah here beside me.
I want to know more.
From my sideline view she's like a surgeon making an incision, every stroke performed with immense concentration and precision.
I've seen her once without that sketchbook.
Does she have any friends? I've not seen her with anybody.
It piques my curiosity to why she's not in the art club.
Wouldn't that be a good place to draw and make friends?
Is she too shy to join?
She peeks up from her pad and catches me staring.
\"Are you... OK?\"
\"Oh, er... yeah.\"
\"Finished?\"
\"N-no, I was just observing...\"
\"...The landscape, I mean.\"
I feel the need to add. She flusters and delves back into her drawing.
I shut my mouth and do the same.
I improve it by merging the buildings and trees into darkness. Who needs detail when the weather is on your side?
Rain droplets leave dark spots on the paper, pulling me from the picture.
\"It's spitting.\"
She lifts her attention from her sketch for a moment.
\"...A little longer.\"
She shivers and goosebumps ascend the back her neck.
I look to the ominous sky and rain starts pelting my face.
As if my very gaze conjured its wrath.
I hoist myself up with a grunt—didn't realise how relaxed I was.
A curious smell emanates from the patch of ground.
\"What's that smell?\"
\"Petrichor.\"
It's like the word was plucked from her lips.
\"Hm? What's that?\"
She looks up with widening eyes, as if she's made a faux pas.
\"The smell of rain on soil after a dry period. I... like it.\"
\"Me too. And I like that you know that.\"
A chuckle escapes her lips and she opts to get ready.
\"...We should head in.\"
A fleeting thought strikes me: I ask Sarah about the art club?
\"Hey... Sarah?\"
\"Hm?\"
\"How come you're not in the club?\"
\"I... I'm just not.\"
Her pace picks up.
\"Is it because people will see your art?\"
\"It's not that...\"
She stops and musters a breath.
\"I had joined before, but...\"
Her sentence wanes into silence.
Was she alone? She's alone now...
Rain trickles from her hair.
\"What if I joined? Would you join with me?\"
She reels back, as suprised as I am.
What am I saying? I don't think I've ever taken an interest by the quality of my picture.
\"You... want to draw?\"
I muster a breath and voice my decision.
\"Yeah...\"
Her tone falls flat.
\"Meet me outside the dorms. Tomorrow, after school.\"
She lowers her head and steps back.
\"I... I need to go.\"
She shoots off, following the perimeter of the school buildings.
\"Wait, Sarah.\"
She doesn't turn to look.
\"I'll see you tomorrow.\"
Was that a yes?
Only tomorrow will tell.
Sarah Act 1
After a day in class to think about it, I'm nervous. I have no stake in art.
I'm envious of Sarah's sense of purpose when she's drawing, and yet, she doesn't seem to want to join herself.
The door creeks open behind me to reveal Sarah.
\"Hey.\"
\"Hey. Let's go...\"
Her eyes don't meet mine.
She remains silent, head still bowed.
There's a sense of determination about her strides, but the worried look on her face makes me uneasy.
Sarah stops outside the room and my momentum sends us tumbling inside.
\"Sorry!\"
\"It's...\"
Her voice stolen by a sharp breath. It's not hard to see why when all eyes are on us.
The classroom erupts into whispers. The air is palpable and the glances pierce.
Sarah lowers her head and strides for a seat at the front.
As I follow, I catch a few coherent sentences from the din.
\"Is that...?\"
\"It can't be.\"
\"Sarah?\"
\"Yeah, the girl from last year.\"
I miss the rest as we make it out of ear shot.
\"Did you hear what happened?\"
The girl leans over and whispers in her friend's ear.
Is this why she was evasive at the mention?
Come to think of it, she shut off when I mentioned it on our walk to the shops too.
I had mistaken it as shyness.
She slumps over the desk and buries her face in her arms. I trudge through knee deep guilt and sit beside her. 
The people sat across from us keep shooting glances, as do the rest of the class.
But the din falls into silence.
My question's answered when I turn to the doorway, where a lanky, ageing man with dark, shaggy hair observes the room.
His gaze comes to a stop on me and Sarah.
\"I see we have new faces in the class. Are you here to join up, or are you here for a taster?\"
Sarah startles at his voice so I speak up.
\"Y-yes, Sir. We're here to join.\"
\"Good, I'm Mr Thatcher. Can I get your names.\"
His words questioning, but his voice demanding.
\"I'm Peter, this is—\"
\"Let her speak for herself, you have already answered once for her.\"
His gaze shifts to Sarah.
\"Can you address me properly, please.\"
I glimpse around the room, feeling the mounting pressure on Sarah.
Shock sweeps across his face as Sarah lifts her head. A smile lightens his stern features.
He strides to his desk without a word, and jots what I assume are our names down on the clipboard.
He then waltzes to the front of his desk and claps his hands together.
\"Right then, class. Today we are going to be doing an imaginative exercise.\"
\"I want you to all draw something that you think represents yourself.\"
\"This can be something you like, or something that is important to you. Abstract or concrete.\"
\"You can use any equipment and style that you like, as this adds to the representation of yourself.\"
\"We'll be starting our projects soon. So take the opportunity to practice now and in the coming weeks.\"
With that said, he sits down and picks out a large stack of paper from his drawer, holding them at different angles and distances as he examines each one.
We wait for the class to get up and take their desired equipment, before picking out a few pencils.
I'm not sure why we have more than one; I just copy Sarah and follow her back to our seats.
I glance around, everybody looks either deep in thought or they're setting to work on the outlines of their representation.
Sarah's huddled over her paper.
A tactical manoeuvre I imagine, to hide her work from prying eyes such as mine.
I notice that every now and then she glances over to the door, it gives me the impression that she wants to escape.
I feel lost as I stare down at the piece of paper, it already represents me as it is.
Blank.
I almost consider handing it in, but I don't fancy two trips to Mr Adams' office in a week.
I place a curved line on the page. Then another.
Before I know it, a face is forming.
The resemblance is uncanny, even through my inept execution.
With the picture of my mother coming into fruition, I huddle over my work like Sarah.
This is a part of myself I'd rather others wouldn't see, with the possibility of them asking questions.
I'm enjoying this more than I thought I would. It's therapeutic.
I carry on trying to refine it, but it never seems to turn out right. Most of the time it turns out worse than before, which is frustrating.
Mr Thatcher stands in front of his desk and clears his throat.
\"Ahem, if I can get your attention.\"
The whole class sit up at attention.
\"The class has finished for today, do what you like with your pictures.\"
\"As I said earlier, your projects will start soon, so get in as much practice as you can in the meantime.\"
I take one last look at my picture before folding it into a square and pocketing it.
I can't say that I'm happy with it, but I'm glad that I did it.
I can't help but question to myself about the whispers and Mr Thatcher's reaction.
\"So... how come you left the art club?\"
Nor can I stop myself from asking, it seems.
\"I... I was busy.\"
It's obviously a lie. I'm not about to pick her up on it, though.
\"How was... your first lesson?\"
I jolt in surprise as she breaks the silence.
\"It was good. I enjoyed it, even if I'm bad at it.\"
\"Can I... take a look?\"
I find myself hesitant with the roles reversed. I now see how hard it can be to just reveal a part of yourself like that.
\"Only if... I can see yours too.\"
Her features debate my proposal.
\"O...K.\"
\"But... I want you to wait in the corridor when we view them.\"
\"Why's that?\"
\"...\"
It's clear that she isn't going to make her reason apparent, so I accept her terms. It's better for me too.
There's a final urge to decline, and not risk her asking questions... but I will have to reciprocate if I expect her to open up.
I wait until she's in her room and unfold her drawing.
The shading is impeccable, contrasting with the thick lines that shape the layers of gloomy clouds across the top, and the deciduous trees that roam along the edges.
A desolate path forms through the middle. The only bit left untouched, is a lonesome unshaded silhouette.
Standing alone amidst the storm and yet, not actually there.
A poignant reminder that we're both loners.
I can see why art appeals to somebody like Sarah. She can express herself to people without being in their presence.
Her door creeps open behind me.
\"She's... beautiful.\"
She whispers wistfully.
\"How could you even see that through my awful drawing?\"
\"It's really... not that bad.\"
\"Yours puts mine to shame.\"
She takes one last look and then we exchange back our pieces.
\"Can I... ask who she is?\"
\"It's my mother, I...\"
Stop myself from going too far.
\"I see...\"
I knew I wasn't ready, yet I still showed it to her.
\"I'll see you around, Sarah.\"
\"B-bye.\"
Her lips part again, but words fail to form.
I hide behind my door incase they do.
Why did I show her?
I made it so much more obvious with my hesitance. Now she knows something's wrong. Now she's going to want to pry.
I muster a deep breath and relax with my exhale.
The woman in the picture captures my eye.
This woman is an angel in my dreams. Maybe she was once an angel in my life. But now all I can hear is her ear-piercing scream.
\"Peter! Good to see you again.\"
His flourish becoming an annoyance; I force a smile as I take the seat.
\"How are things?\"
\"Good.\"
\"I'm glad to hear.\"
He clasps his hands and rests his elbows on his desk.
\"My sources tell me you've joined the art club, convincing Sarah no less.\"
\"I did...\"
\"I'm impressed. I've been asking her for some time.\"
This draws a real smile from me.
\"Yeah, but I'm not sure how well I fare with art.\"
\"Do you enjoy it?\"
\"I can't say I don't.\"
\"Then isn't that what matters?\"
I shrug.
His brow furrows as he assesses me.
\"I'll tell you what I can about Sarah, if you listen to my advice.\"
He assesses me too well. I accept his terms with a nod.
\"Sarah is avoidant. She's had more than a few problems because of this in her life, and here is no different.\"
How can I be so self obsessed? Of course she has problems. I'm not the only one with a cross to bear.
I've been ready to drop this whole art club thing.
\"Can I ask what problems?\"
\"I must clarify that I can't speak much about Sarah, confidentiality, but I'll tell you what I can.\"
\"But I want you to promise me something.\"
\"What?\"
\"That you will speak with me, honestly.\"
I inhale and nod once again.
I've already said too much to Sarah. As far as I know, she may tell him about my reaction to the picture.
\"Sarah had a friend. A friend that moved away close to the time she stopped attending the art club.\"
\"I also know art is her passion. If you're able to help her stick it out, I'd be grateful.\"
\"Thank you.\"
He looks to me expectantly. Awkward silence lingers...
Damn, I expected more.
\"I... I've been having dreams.\"
His brow tilts.
\"What about?\"
\"My...\"
The word sticks in my throat.
\"...Parents.\"
\"Do you miss them?\"
This question brings my own brow to tilt.
I can't tell whether he knows they're dead...
Does he know I can't remember...?
\"That's the thing... I can't remember them.\"
His eyes squint in confusion.
Apparently not...
\"...I can't remember anything past about a year ago.\"
I kick myself for dropping my guard, but I can't rationalise why I'm so guarded.
He acknowledges me with a, \"hm,\" and scribbles down his thoughts as expected.
\"And you don't remember anything of your parents?\"
\"No, nothing.\"
His scribbling stops as his eyes search mine.
\"What are your dreams about?\"
I've already passed the event horizon.
I run through the details of my dreams and give some context...
\"So it was only recent that your dreams took a dark turn?\"
\"Yeah.\"
\"Do you remember anything from before the accident?\"
\"I can't remember anything since I woke up in that hospital bed.\"
His scribbling comes to an end.
\"I originally instructed this for the betterment of Sarah, but I believe she will more than better you, too.\"
\"As for you, I think you may be suffering from anxiety. Your dreams strangely signify PTSD.\"
\"I can offer antidepressants.\"
My face contorts at his offer.
\"Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to say you're crazy. Or anything else you've heard.\"
\"Antidepressants are a viable solution to anxiety.\"
\"I can manage a prescription, but only if you agree.\"
I wave his offer away and head for the door.
\"I'll think about it. Thanks.\"
\"Wait, I also want to speak to you about--\"
I've had as much as I can take for one day.
The curdling in my stomach makes me feel like I've just made the biggest mistake of my new life.
I think back to all those times I'd asked about my parents. My uncle would shut off every time, revealing so little.
I stopped enquiring before long. It was easier to leave that life buried.
Either way, my lungs are lighter having spilled my dreams.
I take what solace I can from his confidentiality.
I arrive and sit myself in the same seat as last time.
As the class enter, Sarah sits down beside me again.
We match an awkward nod and smile.
Beneath the table, her fingers clasp into her thighs.
It looks painful.
As painful as thinking of our last encounter. It feels so awkward now.
Mr Thatcher clears his throat and relays instructions.
The lesson ends. We haven't spoken a word.
The class leave; I remain in hesitation.
It'd be too awkward to walk back together.
As I leave, Sarah is talking to some girls from the club. Our gazes catch and I turn away.
Since my last interactions with her and Mr Adams, I've distanced myself from everyone.
Having spent the week practising, the novelty of art has quickly faded.
I stare out the window to the waning sun.
I'm not as good as I thought I was. Sarah's encourgement feels a mile away now.
I've been trying to improve my technique, looking up guides and watching videos on the internet.
Watching people create art I'd be proud of—and to them, this is just a tutorial...
I clench my fist; the pencil's nib tears into the paper and snaps.
Is this really for me? Why did I sign myself up for this…?
Sarah.
If I hadn't asked her to join, we'd have no reason to speak.
Not like we speak anyway.
I keep kicking myself for not speaking to her in the lesson.
I've asked her to join and have been distant because of my own problems.
I find myself outside my door, trying to build the courage to knock on her room again.
I don't know what to say. Maybe I could ask her to come out again.
She always seems to say yes.
Is she really afraid of saying no? I chuckle to myself at how cute that is.
But my amusement ends with a twinge at the whole art club situation.
Between the lessons and what Mr Adams said, something is clearly off.
Here goes...
My knocks leave me frozen to the spot, again.
Her eyes peek from the opening.
\"Hey... I'm sorry to disturb you. I was just wondering if you wanted to do something?\"
My wordy greeting is met with a smile.
\"...Like what?\"
I manage a queasy smile and a shrug.
\"I... sometimes go to the forest...\"
\"Won't it be too dark soon?\"
\"We... could go to the park.\"
\"Sounds like a plan.\"
We share an awkward chuckle. But I couldn't be happier that she's accepted.
The stars protrude from the sky, signifying the clearest night since I've been here.
The cold air stings my nostrils, giving me an idea.
\"Hey, we should get a coffee. Pick a place and I'll pay. Sound good?\"
She nods and leads.
We saunter into the park in silence, it's not awkward though.
I carry our drinks on a cardboard drink holder.
\"Wanna sit down somewhere and drink these?\"
\"It would kinda defeat the purpose if they cooled down.\"
She chuckles and nods.
A smile rests on her lips as we park ourselves on a nearby bench.
With our small amount of force-talk, I'm no longer optimistic about our outing.
Sarah's more guarded even than me. I don't know how to approach her.
When it comes down to it, the only subject we've had is art. And I know nothing.
But I can't say that I dislike her placid company.
What does Sarah think about me...?
But when I look at her, she's lost in her own world.
Her lips flicker as her gaze sweeps across the night sky. It's like a ritual, as if she's counting or naming the stars.
\"I... take it you like the stars?\"
She breaks from her reverie with a smile.
\"Yeah, I... like nights like this.\"
Though her smile is sweet, her eyes glint with melancholy.
It was what I had come to expect from her. I had gotten used it to the point that it took a smile to make me realise.
She takes her beverage from the holder and gives thanks, cupping it in her hands and taking a sip.
I follow suit, the warmth sends goosebumps up my arms. The joint steam of our drinks and breaths dissipate into the night.
\"I'd sometimes to go down to a park near my uncle's house; the stars were prevalent in the countryside.\"
My words dissipate in the air, as if the breeze blew them away.
\"What...\"
She whispers, trailing off as quickly as she began.
\"Hm?\"
She takes a deep breath, as if it was the courage to breathe the words.
\"What do you... think about when you look at the stars?\"
The question stumps me. I feel like I've been put on the spot, as though it could decide my grade for a test.
I realise the truth will suffice.
\"Back then? It was a beautiful night. I stared for hours, reflecting on my life, wondering what my place is in all this...\"
Or at least partial truth, I'd also asked myself why didn't I die in that crash?
That night... I wished I had.
\"I... used to view them from my auntie's back garden. It was one of the places I could be alone.\"
\"I could lose myself, knowing there was so much more out there...\"
Her fingers wind around the bench as she gazes into the stars.
\"I would... wonder if there was other life out there. There could be something looking into its own night sky, wondering the same thing as me...?\"
I chuckle at her far out nebulous thoughts, evoking a blush.
\"I wouldn't argue against it—it could be possible.\"
I'm met by an intrigued gaze that wills me to continue. My mind runs dry.
\"Do you think... there's other life out there?\"
But it seems she can’t contain her inquisitive nature or I my chuckle.
\"There's an estimated two-hundred-billion galaxies in the observable universe, each containing a billion or so stars.\"
\"Then consider each star can harbour multiple planets...\"
A smile perches on her lips. She takes in the night sky, awe renewed.
I imagine the sky as a canvas in her mind.
\"Observable universe?\"
\"Think of it like the horizon, but it's at the point where space is expanding away from us faster than light can reach us.\"
\"How do you know?\"
\"Heh. Let's just say I had the time on my hands to watch more than a few space documentaries.\"
Our conversation dries up. I follow her gaze into the sky, a lazy smile resting on my lips.
It's funny, this is the last conversation I thought I'd have here. Hell, I had doubts that I would make a friend at all.
The few annoying drama shows I watched were all I had to go off. They didn't prepare me for school, never mind this.
Then again, Sarah seems different anyway. I can't place my finger on her.
I'm drawn to her movements in my peripheral. She lowers her cup and catches my gaze.
\"Where do you think everything came from?\"
I contain my snort and brandish a smile.
\"Nobody knows. The big bang is the theory accepted by the majority in the scientific community.\"
Her head tilts and her lips scrunch up.
\"So if it's true, we were all once the same point?\"
\"Yeah, I guess so...\"
\"Never thought of it like that before.\"
She responds with a smile. It's not forced either, nor was this topic.
Which strikes me as strange in itself; just asking for her name caused her discomfort and she's comfortable talking about this?
Her strange musings perpetuate my own. My impressions of her have been shattered.
And I was confused enough to begin with.
I finish my coffee with a final swill.
\"Finished?\"
\"Yeah.\"
\"Wanna go for a walk?\"
She smiles and rises.
The wind whispers through the tops of the trees.
She's still pensive, gazing into the sky—I can't help smile at how relaxed she is.
\"Wouldn't it have been easier for there to have been nothing?\"
\"I guess not... We're here, aren't we?\"
\"True...\"
\"Why, does the thought of nothing scare you?\"
\"Sometimes... Sometimes it comforts me.\"
\"I... think I can agree there.\"
It's satisfying to see her smile, even at relating to a depressing revelation.
I check my phone, 10pm.
\"Should we head back? It's getting late.\"
She answers with a nod.
She remains pensive as we make our way back—as am I.
As far as my goals go, this was a success, but nothing like I'd imagined it.
\"Peter?\"
Her whisper breaks me from my thoughts.
\"Hm?\"
\"Do you think... I'm weird?\"
I can't help chuckle. I would consider her out of the ordinary, to say the least.
\"Yeah, a little.\"
Realising she could take my answer and laughter the wrong way, I’m quick to amend myself.
\"But not in a bad way, it's refreshing.\"
She blushes and lowers her head, but I can see the smile tugging on her lips. It's contagious.
She composes herself with a new air of confidence.
\"Would you like... to come for a walk in the forest sometime?\"
She shoots an anxious glance from behind her fringe.
Does she think I'd say no?
\"Sure, sounds good.\"
She releases a sigh, smile beaming on her lips.
This is the first time Sarah has offered to do something with me, off of her own volition.
The thought leaves a smile on my lips for the journey home.
Dammit—even after copying tutorials—I still can't get her eyes right.
I have to keep trying...
A knock disturbs me. I sigh and drop the pencil.
I open the door and a smile seizes my lips.
\"Hey, Sarah.\"
Sarah perks up and greets me with a nod.
\"...Would you like to come to the forest?\"
\"Sure!\"
The fact she's followed through with this...
\"Give me a moment to get ready.\"
When she turns to lead the way, a worn looking satchel hangs from her back.
As we reach the steps, she relaxes with a deep breath.
It all feels a little surreal. The air is fresh; the birds sing subtle melodies; the trees sway in the afternoon breeze.
It all brings with it a carefree smile to my face.
The sun creeps through openings in the canopy. Specs of dust dance in the rays of light.
She slows, a gentle smile resting on her lips. I follow her gaze to see two butterflies flying in circles together.
She imbues the simple things with a sense of wonder.
All of a sudden she stops and brushes away some leaves. She picks up a stone and inspects it before slipping it into her satchel.
\"What are you doing?\"
\"Collecting pebbles.\"
I'm not exactly sure what to say to that—it's a stone—but I feel a need to keep the conversation going.
\"Is it a hobby of yours?\"
\"Well... kinda.\"
\"Ah... cool.\"
But quickly run out of things to say.
Although I do enjoy her placid company, it's hard to appease my curiosity of her.
It's like there's a wall around her, and every time I seem to remove a brick, she replaces it with another.
It only adds to her mysterious nature. I'm fascinated to learn more about her, her past, and her… memories.
Yet, I'm too scared to ask as she will most likely expect me to reciprocate.
Contrition settles in my stomach when I realise I'm hiding behind my own wall.
It makes me question my part in this—how can I expect her to open up if I'm holding out myself...?
My thoughts put a downer on my good mood; one thing I could say that I'm consistently good at.
As we reach the reservoir, she stops and takes in the view; I follow suit.
The placid water is like a symbol of the atmosphere, in scenery and company.
But it breaks as I see a movement in my peripheral, and a stone skimming across the water… four, five, six-seven-eight-nine.
\"Woah.\"
I turn to her; she flashes a bashful smile and shrugs.
\"This is why… it was kinda my hobby.\"
She proceeds to take out another stone and lines herself up, leaning her left leg forward and following through with a twist in her abdomen.
I hear it skim eight times, but can't take my eyes from Sarah.
\"Want one?\"
I inspect the rock, noticing it's smooth, flat, and rounded.
I set myself up, trying to imitate her throwing posture, but I only get an initial bounce.
She hands me another.
\"You've got the stance down, but allow it to spin off of your finger.\"
\"Like this.\"
She demonstrate how to hold the stone, and motions how it should flick from the tip of the index finger.
\"The spin will keep it steady when it deflects off of the water's surface.\"
I follow her advice the best I can... one, two, three-four-five.
\"Hey, did you see that?\"
She nods and giggles sweetly, lining herself up for another throw.
\"Do you do this often?\"
\"Sometimes...\"
\"Alone?\"
\"The past few times...\"
\"What about those girls from the art club?\"
\"They're... not my friends...\"
Her pebble sinks without a single skim.
\"I see...\"
\"Well, thanks for bringing me.\"
She matches my smile.
\"It's nice to have company...\"
I can't agree more...
I take another stone and manage a decent throw.
\"Sarah?\"
\"Yeah?\"
I fight with ways to phrase my circumstances.
\"What... do you think's left of a person who's lost their memories?\"
She skims a stone and tilts her head in thought.
\"That's hard... I think deep down they'd still be similar, but your experiences shape you.\"
\"It reminds me of an old Russian proverb: dwell on the past and you'll lose an eye; forget the past and you'll lose both eyes.\"
\"What makes you ask?\"
\"I've just been wondering what makes people who they are...\"
\"I'm interested in psychology, but I'm probably not the best person to ask.\"
\"No, it's a good answer. Thank you.\"
She nods and holsters her stone.
\"What's your passion, Peter?\"
Her sudden question leaves my mouth open and brain frozen.
\"I... I don't know.\"
Her brow furrows. Her lips twist and her smile returns.
\"Not many people do...\"
It only makes me question myself more. Is art really for me?
There's one thing I do know, I don't regret my decision to join.
Sarah throws another and scores eleven.
\"That was the last one...\"
She zips up her satchel and motions to leave.
I'm still pensive about her response.
It's always been clear that I've been blind to the past, but that makes me blind to the future too?
But for the first time, I'm beginning to look forward to the future.
\"It's been—\"
I'm put off by a giant bee in my peripheral, buzzing loudly by my ear.
It anticipates my every move as I dodge left and right.
\"Argh!\"
\"S-stop, moving around so much!\"
I run away and manage to evade the the bee.
As I return, she covers her mouth with the back of her hand, giggling sweetly.
In these first few weeks together, I realise that this is the first time I've seen her genuinely laugh.
I chuckle and rub the nape of my neck.
\"Well, I'm glad to be of some entertainment.\"
\"But... it's been nice. Thanks for bringing me.\"
Her lowering hand reveals her smile.
\"It has... Thanks for coming...\"
We've both decided to head straight to the art room; I sit myself down and wait for Sarah.
Our gazes catch and a smile seizes her lips as she turns away.
\"Hey.\"
\"Hey.\"
Just a small greeting is nice after our silence last lesson.
The lesson is uneventful.
Sarah seems busy by the back, but when I make my way over she's staring into the equipment.
\"Got any plans for your project?\"
\"Not really...\"
Laughter echoes in from the hallway. She stiffens and gazes toward the window.
\"Should we go?\"
She nods.
As I make my way out, I can feel her presence dragging in tow.
The laughter continues; it's the same girls I saw her speaking to after last lesson. Sarah shrinks as they approach.
The smallest girl meets us. She's blonde with a small frame and a confident strut.
\"Hey, Sarah.\"
There's a moment of silence as Mr Thatcher passes through.
Her eyes narrow.
\"Do you think coming back with a guy is going to change things?\"
\"No... It's not—\"
Sarah's wavering voice sinks my stomach into the pit of realisation.
\"What's going on here?\"
The girl's lips squeeze into a smirk.
\"Sarah's not as straight as she seems.\"
A red flush paints Sarah's cheeks.
\"It's not that—\"
\"Don't lie!\"
Sarah startles. Her outburst even catches me off guard.
\"What business is that of yours?\"
\"She made it my business when she kissed her in front of me.\"
\"Tongues and everything.\"
Her eyes narrow at Sarah.
\"You're a freak.\"
The scorn in her voice matched by sniggers from her friends.
Rage wells up my throat.
\"You need to shut your mouth.\"
I position myself between her and Sarah, thrusting my finger in her face.
\"Are you threatening me?\"
Sarah tugs my sleeve but I'm not about to back down.
\"I'm warning you.\"
\"Do you even know who I am?\"
\"Some bitch.\"
\"This bitch's brother will shut your mouth.\"
\"Is that why you’re a bitch? Because you can hide behind others?\"
Her friends grab onto her shoulders.
\"C'mon, we need to go.\"
\"Fine.\"
She looks over me with a scoff and addresses Sarah.
\"Go and slit your wrists. I'm sure your boyfriend will help.\"
She shoots a grin as they walk through the doors.
I turn to Sarah who’s burying her gaze into the ground.
\"Are you OK?\"
She grasps her thigh and exhales.
\"I'm sorry...\"
\"Why are you sorry?\"
\"...I knew I shouldn’t have come back here.\"
\"This isn't your fault. They shouldn't treat you like that.\"
She stiffens up, her arms tremble by her sides.
\"Look, it'll be OK.\"
I place my hand on her shoulder, but she flinches to my touch.
\"You… you don’t know her brother.\"
Her quivering voice leaves me in a moment of doubt. But I cast a stern tone.
\"Have you told Mr Thatcher about this?\"
She shifts her head to the side.
\"What about Mr Adams?\"
Then the other side.
\"You need to tell them.\"
She snatches a breath and snaps towards the exit.
I barely keep up; I'm left to watch on as she shuts her door.
\"Sarah?\"
...
\"Sarah?!\"
......
It's clear she wants to be alone.
I slam my fist on the desk.
What had they said to her after the last lesson?
...I just walked on by, lost in my own worries. Useless.
Go and slit your wrists.
It shocked me to hear her say it.
How could a human being say that to another?
I shudder at my naive question.
I can't settle my mind or the anger in my stomach. I can't believe how horrible that bitch would treat Sarah.
My palm keeps connecting with her cheek in my mind's eye, knowing I couldn't do it...
With a clearer head, I brood over yesterday's events.
I didn't know I had it in me to defend her like that. I don't think I'd have defended myself like that.
But the scorn she treated Sarah with... just for being... different.
The thought resparks a pang of anger.
Why would Sarah have joined the club again? Because of my whim?
I need to talk to Mr Adams. He wouldn't have urged her to rejoin if he'd known.
But my stomach falls empty; I don't think we'd have spoken much without my whimsical choice.
Would we drift apart without this rivet of art? It's a question I've put more weight on than I realised...
As I leave for class, I'm caught up with an urge to knock on Sarah's door.
But what would I say? She's probably left for class anyway.
Just as I'm getting into the swing of schoolwork, my concentration is knocked.
Jennifer waves and glances over a few times, but she doesn't speak.
I could've used a distraction. But I can't deny that I've pushed her away.
I push everyone away.
His annoying flourish a familar comfort at this moment.
\"How can I help you?\"
I explain through the details to Mr Adams.
\"It sounds like Rachel. She's a troublesome one...\"
\"As for Sarah, I had expected something beyond what she had told me. I wasn't aware of the exact reason why she'd stopped attending.\"
He pauses in thought and releases a sigh.
\"I had presumed it was due to Emma leaving...\"
His pensive expression insinuates he's thinking aloud as much as tellign me.
\"Why did Emma leave?\"
\"Confidentiality.\"
It's not the answer I want to hear, but Sarah is the focus here.
He breaks from the screen. 
\"The registers indicate that Sarah hasn't been in class today.\"
\"What should I do?\"
\"I recommend that you don't return to the art club for the time being. I will inform Mr Thatcher.\"
\"So we're the ones being punished for it?\"
His face stiffens, but eases as he catches my eyes.
\"I know you're upset, but procedures must be followed. I think the best thing you can do right now is to make sure Sarah's OK.\"
\"But I've tried... I knocked on her room afterwards and she didn't answer.\"
\"She would've wanted some space, I'm sure. She'll let you in when she's ready.\"
An easy smile rests on his lips.
\"besides, I've heard you've both spent some time together outside of school.\"
\"We have...\"
\"I think it might be a good idea for you to go and see her.\"
He's right.
\"But, what should I say to her?\"
\"What have you spoken about so far?\"
A smile seizes my lips from our conversation at the park.
I don't think now's the right time to talk to her about the orgin of the universe.
\"Your smirk assures me you'll be fine.\"
\"Sarah's stronger than she appears. But I'm sure she'd appreciate a friend right now.\"
\"Thank you.\"
This time, I offer him a handshake and he claps down with both hands.
\"Believe me, I'm worried about Sarah, too. I'm glad she's found a new friend in you.\"
As I turn to leave, he calls out.
\"Take some time with this, but please come back and talk to me about yourself when you're ready.\"
I have a friend, Sarah.
I almost smile, but I know she needs someone right now.
The sound of footsteps fill me with hope and apprehension.
I knock; the lock clicks and the door creeps ajar. She pokes her eye in the frame.
\"H-hey...\"
She measures me, waiting for me to begin.
\"Hey.\"
Silence constricts my lungs. She's right here, and it's like I can't reach her.
\"Have you been to class?\"
I know the answer, but it's the only question I have.
She sinks into herself, gaze fixed on my shoes.
What confidence I had slumps into a stupor. My mouth opens, but my words are lost.
After a few tense moments, she steps from behind the door; it creeks open.
She's let me in...
Her room strikes me as archaic compared to my own. But her room looks neglected; a few used plates, crisp packets, cans, and numerous paper balls are scattered across her room.
She navigates her way through the mess and sits on her bed. Her head craned towards the back wall.
\"...Are you… OK?\"
It's painful to ask such a stupid question given the sight. I feel stranded and ashamed as I stare at her from across the room.
It takes her a few seconds for her response: a nod, and a strained smile that twists my heart.
I force myself to take the difficult first step, and make my way over to the bed. I sit down gingerly beside her.
\"Do you want to talk—\"
My words are stolen by a shake of her head.
Time seems to stand still in the room; I'm not sure whether I'm the cause, or if she's secluded herself in here like this since yesterday.
There's this distinct feeling that I shouldn't be here gnawing at me...
But the significance that she's let me in isn't lost on me, I'm just not sure what to do if she won't talk.
The feeling that she'd be better off alone wins. I rise, frozen by a tug on my sleeve.
\"D-don't...\"
Unsure of how I should react, I sit back on the bed beside her.
To my surprise, she leans against my shoulder.
Her room has clearly been neglected before this happened, none of the plates look fresh.
I can't help think about the apathetic state I was in at my uncles.
I didn't care about my surroundings; I would do anything to distract myself.
I finally form something to say, but bask in our mutual silence and relish her warmth against me.
The feeling of being needed, that I matter, is enough to make me pause and appreciate another person's touch.
As I look to her, I can't rationalise why I care about this girl beside me so much.
But if she doesn't want to talk, I can at least help with her surroundings.
My surroundings have often been as scatterbrained as my mind.
\"Hey, we should clean up.\"
\"...\"
She blushes, levering herself from my shoulder and taking in the room.
Knowing how hard it is to get out of a rut, I'm ready to push it.
\"Believe me, I've created worse.\"
Although she chuckles, she still looks unsure.
\"Hey, come on. It'll be a lot faster with the two of us.\"
I take the initiative and begin throwing wrappers in the bin, but it's already full.
\"Are there any more bags?\"
\"I think I know where some are...\"
Once she leaves, my curiosity takes over; I unravel a paper ball.
The image within is a shaded silhouette, with a finger gun pressed to its head.
There's one colour, the blood spurting from the exit wound.
The paint is fresh... smudged.
Uncharacteristic from what I've seen of her work.
Her footsteps draw near, so I scrunch it up and throw it towards the bin.
She arrives with the bags and we tackle the room in silence.
Her shoulders ease as she takes in the room.
\"Much better, I need to do the same in my room now.\"
She smirks and stares back to the floor.
But I know I can't let our mutual relaxation get in the way of the situation.
\"Sarah?\"
\"Hm?\"
\"Do you want to go back to the art club?\"
She shrugs and turns her head away.
\"Think about it. Will you at least go to class tomorrow?
Her lips purse.
\"I will...\"
She seems unsure, but there's a certain resolve in her voice.
\"I'll see you around, then.\"
I turn for the door.
\"Bye, Peter.\"
As I reach the door, I turn on the ball of my foot.
\"I'm across the way if you ever need someone to talk to. Even if you just wanna hang out.\"
The smile breaking out on her lips is more than a reward.
\"Thank you.\"
I leave her to her thoughts. I know I've got plenty more to think about myself.
Despite Mr Adams' warning, I never did tell Sarah not to return to the art club today.
I was so focused on her in the moment that I completely forgot...
She did seem doubtful, but there’s no way I can chance leaving her in the lesson by herself after what's happened.
I’m a little early; Sarah is in her space beside mine, in a conversation with Mr Thatcher.
I was ready to leave if she didn't show.
I approach as Mr Thatcher breaks away from a conversation with her.
\"Hey.\"
Her body relaxes with a sigh. A smile breaks out on the corner of her lips.
After seeing her so down in her room, her smile leaves a flutter in my stomach.
\"Hey.\"
Her head rests a notch higher with the absence of Rachel.
\"Got any ideas for your project?\"
She nods as she flicks her pad open. At ease when it comes to art.
It's a familiar view, school buildings and dorms in front of the forest.
\"You've been on the roof?\"
She responds with a nod.
\"I want to make a collage of landscapes.\"
\"Good idea.\"
\"What are you going to do?\"
My smile yields as I scrunch my lips in thought.
\"I… don’t know. Haven’t really thought about it.\"
All I’ve been able to think about is how Rachel treated her.
About her locking herself in her room.
About her resting against my shoulder…
\"You could do some landscapes with me... That's... if you want?\"
\"Yeah, sure!\"
\"I found it easier to do landscapes than... people.\"
She gives a satisfied nod as Mr Thatcher Grabs the class's attention.
The session wraps up, I don’t think it could’ve gone better.
Mr Thatcher has surely intervened with Rachel, even her friends have been absent.
I've managed to learn a better shading technique with the help of Sarah.
And the fact Sarah's been so responsive in a lesson is a blessing in itself.
\"Are you going to work on something later?\"
\"I had just planned to go back to my room.\"
\"When are you going to start working on another piece?\"
\"I might do later.\"
\"Can I come if you do?\"
\"Sure.\"
\"Just knock on if you feel up to it.\"
\"I will.\"
Sarah's features tighten as we reach the dorms.
I realise why as I follow her gaze. It's Rachel, and what I assume is her older brother.
\"Ryan, meet Peter.\"
Her voice loaded with malice.
A pang of fear freezes over my spine when his eyes lock on mine.
This guy is massive; his short hair descends to his beard that adorns his gritted teeth.
\"What the fuck did you say to my little sister?\"
He slams his chest into mine, nostrils flaring; his ragged breath assaults my own.
\"L-look, we don't want any trouble.\"
Despite my wavering voice, I puff out my chest.
\"Do you even know why I defended Sarah?\"
His fingers flex into a fist.
Before I can react I'm flailing back, jaw smarting from impact.
My heart pounds to the beat of adrenaline. I hoist myself up, wary of another blow.
\"S-stop, listen!\"
He's not listening. I step back and avoid his next swing
\"Get off me, bitch!\"
We turn to find Sarah's pinned down Rachel. Ryan turns his sights.
\"Get off'o her!\"
You're not touching Sarah.
I catch his jaw with a right hook that shocks even myself. Words bubble from my lips.
\"Listen, you fucking idiot! Your bitch of a sister told Sarah to slit her wrists.\"
Despite the anger burning down my throat, the words are cast cold.
Adrenaline floods to the tips of my fingers; I assault his shield of arms.
He lunges forward; his tackle taking me off guard.
We crash to the ground, his weight crushes the air from my lungs.
His fist connects with my eye.
Then my nose; my eyes well up and the taste of blood rises from the back of my throat.
\"Ryan! Get off him!\"
Dean drags him back with the help of a familiar member of staff.
\"Get off! I'll kill him.\"
I pick myself up but my legs give way; I stumble forward and catch myself on hands and knees.
Sarah rushes over, lifting me from under my arms.
\"Oh my God! Are you OK?\"
I nod in response, residual adrenaline coursing through my veins.
My ears ring and my head lolls. Blood drips down my chin onto her sleeve.
\"Sorry 'bout that.\"
She brings her face level and looks into my eyes.
\"I'm fine.\"
A hand print reddens her cheek.
\"Are you OK?\"
\"Yeah, I'm OK.\"
\"Peter! Come with me.\"
Another teacher collects Sarah as I follow.
I don't want to face the world today.
The thoughts of how I hadn't warned Sarah not to attend keep playing on my mind.
And my ego is an open wound.
For a moment, I had thought everything was OK.
Sarah had actually begun to open up since the first time, and it happens again.
Mr Brent instructed me to go to the staffroom this morning. At least I get to skip some of first period.
\"Peter! Take a seat.\"
I pull up the chair.
\"Your story checks out from what footage I can find on camera.\"
\"Thanks for checking through it so soon.\"
\"I've been looking through their records and they seem to have been invloved in numerous instances.\"
\"I can assure you that the necessary actions will be taken.\"
I take what solace I can, hoping they'll never return.
\"Have you spoken to Sarah?\"
\"No, I'm not certain who she spoke to.\"
\"So, is that everything cleared up, can I go?\"
\"Certainly. Don't hesistate to find me if you have any more problems.\"
He flashes a wink. It feels out of place.
\"Thanks.\"
I'm not ready for class today...
I'm anxious to see Sarah. Things had seemed bad enough after the first time.
\"Sarah?\"
I press my ear to the door. Nothing.
I follow an inkling...
\"Thought I'd find you here.\"
She stiffens and the pebble slips from her fingers.
I take it from the ground and manage six skims.
\"Got any more?\"
She lays her satchel between us, taking another and lining herself up.
\"I'm sorry.\"
We keep our gazes fixed out on the reservoir.
\"Don't be.\"
\"I knew she was still there... I thought I could've avoided something like that.\"
I shrug, taking another stone.
\"Shit happens.\"
I manage a calm tone, but just thinking about it ignites anger in my stomach.
\"Thank you.\"
I ease up, lifting my brow.
\"What for? Getting my arse kicked?\"
Venom leaks from my wounded ego.
\"For sticking up for me. For... being here for me...\"
\"If I hadn't asked you... \"
\"You didn't know. And you could've dropped it when you did... \"
\"I wouldn't have...\"
Whether I stayed because I felt it was my fault or for the fact I'm able to spend time with Sarah conflict.
\"What made you go back?\"
She tilts her head. Such nuances about her seem amplified.
\"It was a promise I'd made...\"
\"To who?\"
\"Emma...\"
\"When Rachel... saw... she started calling me out.\"
She stumbles and tries to push more words out. I skim another stone in silence.
\"Before Emma left, I drew a picture for her and shared it with the class...\"
\"Rachel spread rumours... and pulled my hair in front of her friends...\"
\"How come... you didn't hit her when you had the chance?\"
\"I... didn't want to hurt her. I don't like hurting anything...\"
No matter how naive it seems, all I can think is you're an angel.
\"...Emma had me promise her that I'd keep art up and not let people like her stop me from the club...\"
\"Sounds like you were close.\"
A wry smile twists her lips.
\"Yeah...\"
\"Since Emma left, haven't you made any friends?\"
\"No.\"
Her candid answer leaves us in silence. I fight with curiosity.
\"Why not?\"
\"I... I don't really like people.\"
Sometimes I question whether or not I should be here.
\"What about me?\"
She glances into my eyes. It takes her a moment to pierce my soul.
\"You're... different.\"
For the first time... I'm happy to be... different.
We finish off the stones in mutual silence.
Somehow, I feel closer to her than ever.
We sit on the bank, watching the sun's reflection dance on the water.
My smile weighs on my aching jaw. But with this girl beside me, I can't help it.
\"I have to say, the melodies of the birds are so relaxing.\"
I attempt to retain the lightened mood.
\"Not if you're a worm.\"
I follow her gaze to a worm on the bank and chuckle.
Just what goes through that head of hers?
\"Can worms even hear?\"
She shrugs, smile pulling on the corners of her lips.
\"Iunno.\"
Sarah Act 2
I've never gone this far up Long Rd, but Sarah seems determined.
She's anxious to get there. But she never told me where we were going.
She turns off into a graveyard.
I wasn't expecting this.
She's quiet, following a predetermined path.
She slows and homes in on a gravestone. A lump wedges itself in my throat.
\"Who...\"
\"A gentleman, once named Sam Davidson.\"
\"Did you know him?\"
\"No. It's just... the message on his gravestone.\"
The sharp lump in my throat softens and I swallow it.
The gravestone reads, \"I used to be like you; you'll one day be like me...\"
A serpent curls into a circle below, tail devoured by its own jaws.
\"We'll also be dead soon?\"
\"That's... depressing.\"
I'm surprised to see her lips edge into a smile.
\"It's a reminder to follow your passions in life.\"
\"This...\"
She points to her skull hair piece.
\"...Is a memento mori.\"
\"What's that?\"
\"It's something to remind you that you have to die.\"
\"Again, depressing...\"
\"Wouldn't it make more sense to live now?\"
\"That'd be Carpe Diem. I think memento mori is a roundabout way of saying to live now.\"
\"But how can you really appreciate everything now unless you know it's limited? Precious...\"
Her last word delivered in a whisper.
\"People do it everyday.\"
\"They really seem to... But I can't.\"
I release a wry snort.
\"Yeah, me either.\"
The only time I've really thought of death, was wishing I had in that crash. But if I had, I wouldn't be here now...
\"What about the snake?\"
\"Ouroboros.\"
\"What's that?\"
\"A snake eating its own tail.\"
\"Well, I can see that much.\"
She chuckles.
\"It's symbolic; it's a cycle, like life. \"
\"So like the saying; we'll one day be dead and someone else will be like us now.\"
\"Pretty much.\"
\"So why should you remember you're going to die?\"
I point to her hair piece.
\"Because how can you live now if you don't regard death?\"
\"School, work, retirement.\"
\"But how will you stop planning for the future when you don't see the end in sight?\"
\"Then what does it all even matter when we'll die and be replaced?\"
\"What other meaning is there?\"
I shrug and she begins to unpack her equipment.
As if on cue, rain leaves a few droplets on her pad.
\"Will it be OK to draw? It's spitting.\"
\"It'll be fine.\"
The rain picks up.
\"Should we find shelter?\"
\"I... don't mind the rain.\"
\"It's getting heavy though, is it locked?\"
I point towards the nearby church and she shrugs.
\"One way to find out.\"
\"The groundskeeper lives in the house back there. He might be inside.\"
I rap the iron knocker and seconds of silence respond.
\"Hello?\"
The door yields to a shove.
The creak echoes around the empty building.
We take a seat on a pew and unpack our equipment.
\"Do you believe in God?\"
\"Can't say I do, haven't put much thought into religion. What about you?\"
\"I used to...\"
We're left in silence, save for the rain pattering on the windows.
\"People have told me I'm... unnatural.\"
\"Becuase of Emma?\"
\"Yeah.\"
\"I don't see how, it's found throughout the animal kingdom.\"
\"Mhm.\"
She takes out her pad and begins a sketch. I follow suit.
But I can't keep the questions from circling in my mind.
\"Does that mean there's no meaning?\"
But she's first to break the silence with her own question.
\"If there's no God?\"
\"Yeah.\"
I find myself playing Devil's advocate, despite struggling to find meaning myself.
\"Didn’t you say your skull was to remind you to follow your passion? Isn’t that meaning?\"
\"But what’s left then when you’ve lost what’s meaningful?\"
Did Emma mean that much to her?
\"Don't you have to find meaning?\"
\"Is it that easy?\"
What meaning have I found...?
\"No, I guess not...\"
She measures me and takes a breath.
\"This is how I search. I want to capture the meaning of now in a picture.\"
\"I'm going to be dead much longer than I'm alive. Maybe I can make something that lives longer than me.\"
She retrieves her pad and pencils and sets off to work. My questions fade away as I watch her delve into her mode.
Her eyes pierce the windows and decor between flitting to her sketchpad.
I set to work on my own piece...
\"Have you thought about sharing your art?\"
\"Not really.\"
She continues in her work.
\"There's competitions online and forums where you can post your art.\"
She stops for a moment.
\"It's scary... for people to judge what you've put your heart into.\"
After almost not showing her my picture after the first art lesson, it's hard to find a response.
I join her and begin on a painted glass window...
Sarah wasn't very responsive as we made our way back. She looked exhausted
She wakes up everyday with a reminder that she's going to die. That can't be good for the psyche.
The picture I found in her room flashes through my mind...
Sleep doesn't come easy.
As sleep claims my senses, an image surfaces in my mind—a gravestone.
One of thousands scattered under a bleak sky. The clouds merge from grey to black above above one grave.
The grave before me reads, \"Memory.\"
A spade falls from the air and thumps into the dirt.
I lever the handle, uprooting the earth. I shovel it aside and scoop again.
Again and again. I dig until my chest contracts.
Can't. Breathe!
I have no control, it's like I'm possessed.
As I'm about to suffocate, air fills my lungs. I've hit something solid.
I fall back as the coffin rises to the surface, soil dancing on its surface.
The door swings open, scattering dirt through the air.
A corpse rises into the air enshrouded in a dark mist.
I try to rise but my limbs sink into the mud. It floats forward and lifts its head.
I scream but no sound comes out. I can't turn away; its face meets mine.
I jolt up and gasp for breath.
The image of the decaying face fresh in my mind's eye.
That face... that was me.
I rest my forehead in my palm and stare into my desk.
I'm not ready for class today. Not sure what day I am.
\"Peter.\"
It's not the voice I was expecting.
\"Not interested in Magnum Dilon?\"
\"Sorry, not interested.\"
A pang of guilt stems from my blunt answer. Not like Danielle would spare me remorse.
\"I've just got too much going on.\"
\"I'm glad to see you're being productive then.\"
Productive wouldn't be the right word.
\"Peter!\"
And the voice I first expected intervenes.
\"Later.\"
Danielle's quick to leave the scene.
\"What's up? You've got a face like a slapped arse.\"
\"I'm OK. Just can't seem to get a good night's sleep here.\"
\"You should try some alcohol. Works a treat.\"
\"To get you to sleep I bet, but you won't sleep properly.\"
\"So? Isn't the point of sleep to escape for a little while?\"
It strikes me as a bit too nihilistic for Jennifer. Or what little I know of her.
\"Not really.\"
Mrs Brown enters.
\"Borin' arse.\"
Their interactions leave me with a smile.
My face from the grave...
Was that me?
...Was it a reminder of who I was before?
Is the person who I was before dead now?
Maybe still alive? Buried inside?
\"Peter!\"
\"Hm?\"
\"What do you think the answer is?\"
She points to the board where numerous questions are laid out.
The bottom question being, \"In the Mesozoic Era, how did dinosaurs reproduce?\"
\"Egg?\"
She glares at me.
\"I'll let you off.\"
Thankfully, I've watched too many random documentaries.
Class today dragged. I'm thankful to undress and get into bed.
The decaying image of my face isn't as fresh as it was this morning, but I can't stop thinking about it.
What did that dream mean?
Do dreams really reveal a layer of our subconscious mind as the psychologists say?
Knocks on my door break me from my thoughts.
I can only smile.
Sarah.
I almost answer the door but realise I'm in my boxers.
\"Give me a minute!\"
I put a T-shirt on and fall against my desk as I pull my trousers up.
\"Are you OK?\"
Her voice muffled through the door but I open it.
\"I'm OK. What's up?\"
Sarah greets me with a smile.
\"Wanna work on the collage at the park?\"
\"Sounds good! Give me a minute to get ready.\"
Night falls as we make it to the familiar bench.
I almost wonder why I try as I mess up my picture multiple times.
But when I look at Sarah, I don't care if art isn't for me.
Watching her awe of our surroundings makes my heart melt for reasons I can't articulate.
But I feel a twist as I notice her eyes are brimming with tears.
\"Sarah? Are you OK?\"
Her eyes flicker open and shut but fail to contain a tear.
\"It's just...\"
\"Hm?\"
Her eyes shimmer as she takes in our surroundings.
\"One day everything's going to die. All of this will be dead.\"
\"Me and you... will be dead.\"
\"That's... depressing.\"
\"Is it?\"
A smile breaks her lips.
\"The fact that everything's here; that we're here right now... it blows my mind.\"
\"I want to capture this beauty every time I can see it.\"
\"Life only makes sense in these moments.\"
She delves into her art once more.
I remain stumped at her shifting thought patterns around the ideas.
\"What do you mean by every time you can see it?\"
\"It's rare that we ever realise how beautiful life truly is.\"
\"In a thousand years all of this will be gone. Who knows where nature and humanity will be then.\"
As her words evaporate on the breeze, an urge rises to hug her.
\"Isn't that why right now is so beautiful?\"
\"It is... a beautiful tragedy.\"
I nod in agreement.
Sarah continues her work and I follow suit.
I just can't focus, I want to talk to Sarah.
The small talk rattling around my mind just doesn't seem worthy of distracting her in this mood.
I'm more interested in Sarah than the scenery. I decide to add her into it.
We work in silence...
\"Sorry...\"
\"What for?\"
\"For always bringing up these kinda things.\"
I release a snort and a smile.
\"Y'know, when I met you, I didn't really expect to have conversations like this. I didn't know what to expect moving here.\"
\"Honestly, I was just nervous about the whole situation...\"
She giggles.
\"What did you expect?\"
\"I'm not sure really. I didn't really expect to make friends. I just expected small talk that I wouldn't be able to keep up.\"
The smile remains on her lips.
\"I hate small talk, too. Why did you think you wouldn't make friends?\"
\"I... don't know.\"
\"You're a good person. Anybody would be lucky to have you as a friend.\"
It hits a sentimental spot. Nobody's said something like that to me before.
\"Thanks... I want you to know you're a good person, too.\"
It comes out so awkward, but her smile widens.
\"I'm glad you convinced me to join the club again.\"
\"I've been in such a block since...\"
\"Would you wanna join me at the forest again tomorrow? And I have another spot in mind for later...\"
\"Definitely. I'm looking forward to it.\"
\"I'll meet you at the forest steps after school?\"
\"Sounds good.\"
Sarah rises.
\"We should head back.\"
\"Yeah, it's getting late.\"
\"Thanks, Sarah. I'm enjoying this.\"
Her smile makes my heart melt.
\"Me too.\"
I've been waiting all day for this.
Sarah's already waiting for me by the steps.
She greets me with a smile and I can't contain my own.
\"Hey Sarah, have a good day?\"
She shrugs.
\"I suppose. But I'm looking forward to this.\"
\"Me too.\"
Her gaze curious, but stops in the distance to a felled tree.
\"If a tree falls in the forest and nobody's there to hear it, does it make a sound?\"
Her questions have started already. I can only smile.
\"No, it'd only be vibrations until it hits an ear drum.\"
I can see the gears turning in her head as she contemplates my answer.
\"Would the universe exist if there was no life to experience it?\"
\"Yeah, why wouldn't it?\"
She retreats into thought for a while. And I'm just stumped at her question, it seems obvious.
\"So what about the Shrodinger's cat thing? Where it's a wave or a particle whether or not we obseve it?\"
It takes me a moment to see where she's going.
\"So the universe is just potential until life observes it?\"
She shrugs.
\"Maybe... I know it sounds stupid...\"
\"Even Einstein contested it. A reponse of his to quantum physics, 'is the moon really there when nobody looks?'\"
\"I just don't see what it is without life to observe it. It might as well be nothing.\"
\"I... think I can agree there.\"
\"But why would you want to believe the universe is only potential without us?\"
\"Because what other meaning does life have?\"
\"Doesn't this mean something? That we're here now? Memento mori?\"
Angst wells up in me. Could I give meaning to her?
\"But then what's the point?\"
\"Of us being here now?\"
\"No. What's the point of life?\"
\"I don't know...\"
All I can muster is something generic...
\"Well, isn't the point now? Isn't that what memento mori means? That we're now friends and we're here together?\"
\"We need to take a left here.\"
She brushes off my answer and we take the turn.
It feels like rejection.
Emma... I'm just a friend and she was a lover. Could I ever mean as much?
We remain in silence...
\"It means a lot that you're doing this with me.\"
And my feelings turn in an instant.
\"I'm glad you wanted to do it with me.\"
With nothing else left to say, silence ensues.
We arrive at an opening with a bench and an expansive view.
\"Wow.\"
My smile matches hers.
\"It's beautiful, isn't it.\"
\"It is...\"
\"I last came with Emma.\"
\"Don't other people come here?\"
\"No.\"
\"Then why's there a bench?\"
\"It's a memorial, for a Mrs Eames. I've never seen her family here... or anyone else.\"
\"It's a beautiful spot, even better without other people.\"
She smiles and nods at my answer, taking a seat on the bench. I join.
\"I'm sorry, but I really want to focus on my work here.\"
\"No problem, I'll focus on my own work.\"
...
...
Sarah really has been quiet, deep in her work.
I nudge her.
\"Should we go soon? It's starting to get late.\"
\"This is the best time...\"
It's certainly beautiful, but I rather wouldn't go back through the forest in the dark.
\"Ahem.\"
A voice startles us from behind.
It's Mr Brent.
\"You guys should head back, it'll be dark soon.\"
We start packing our equipment. Even after realising there's no threat, Sarah's still anxious.
Mr Brent parted with us at the school gates.
\"Something about him just gives me a bad feeling.\"
\"He helped us when it happened here...\"
\"I'm just grateful it wasn't Ryan who found us there.\"
Sarah agrees with a nod, but still seems unsure.
We resume in silence.
Sarah breaks the silence when we reach our doors.
\"I said I had another place in mind...\"
\"Do you want to come with me next weekend?\"
\"Sure, sounds good.\"
\"I'll see you Friday.\"
True to her word, I haven't seen her until today.
A few cars pass, but it's almost dead.
Despite that, I can still feel the gravitas of the outing. Sarah's tense.
\"I wasn't sure whether to come here... but I think it's right.\"
She leans her elbows against the rails and sways back and forth.
I follow suit beside her, but lean back due to feeling uneasy.
A motorway runs below. Moonlight glimmers on the distant lake.
\"Do you trust yourself?\"
\"What do you mean?\"
\"Do you ever get an urge to jump? Like something's pulling you towards the edge?\"
\"Yeah, a little.\"
\"It's the call of the void.\"
\"That's what I feel when I create art. I'm scared, but it pulls me to the edge.\"
\"Why do you think about all of this stuff so much?\"
\"I can't help it... I just can't understand...\"
\"Understand what?\"
\"What's the meaning of anything? I don't understand how people can live their lives without questioning...\"
\"Questioning what?\"
\"Everything...\"
\"Why does anything exist at all? Why is life here? Why has life found the ability to question itself? Why then does it often choose not to?\"
\"But isn't that what religion is? Isn't that what science is?\"
\"But how do they not question it? Why do they accept so easy?\"
\"Life is hard... when you're trying to survive day by day, it's easier to accept a paradigm.\"
\"But then why live at all?\"
\"Instincts? Family? Love? Wealth? Pleasure?\"
\"Is that really all there is?\"
I can only shrug.
\"I mean why then did we create religions? Why would we create the scientific method? There has to be something we're looking for.\"
\"It seems so. Maybe we'll never find it.\"
\"That's... depressing.\"

Please be patient for the credits, there's also a .txt file.
...
We walk back in silence.
I feel like an opportunity just slipped through my fingers.
...
...
Rain pelts the window. It's the first time it's rained since my arrival.
I draw out my phone and send a message to Dest—Danielle.
L0stc4us3: Long time no speak.
It's a strange coincidence. Though, I've never been sure what she thinks of me.
x-Destiny-x: Hello.
She never makes it easy.
L0stc4us3: Wuu2?
x-Destiny-x: Working on my project.
L0stc4us3: Your game?
x-Destiny-x: Yes. What else would it be?
Damn. Touchy.
I'm not sure what to say, so I'm glad for another message.
x-Destiny-x: Did you like Magnum Dilon?
L0stc4us3: Can't say, I was too busy dying.
x-Destiny-x: That's because you're a noob.
                                                  ...
x-Destiny-x: Do you want to join me again on Saturday? Though, there's a catch.
L0stc4us3: What's the catch?
x-Destiny-x: My friend will be online, so you'll have to buy an account.
L0stc4us3: Sure. I'd rather play the game than fight you.
x-Destiny-x: See you around, noob.
I might as well head down early. I'm going to buy an account anyway.
It's not open yet. I knock and get no response.
I spot that strange teacher dawdling down the corridor.
His pensive expression accentuates his slim jawline and the lines of age in his cheeks.
What was his name again...?
\"Hey, Mr Adams.\"
He looks up and raises his brow.
\"No, wrong person; I'm Mr Brent.\"
\"Ah, sorry.\"
\"Hey, Mr Brent.\"
His face melts into a smile as he looks up.
\"I'm surprised you remembered.\"
\"Yeah. We're the new guys.\"
I fail to mention that he's eccentric or the fact there's a lot of new students even when you disregard the first years.
I wait until he's close.
\"Hey, Mr...\"
\"Mr Brent.\"
I offer an awkward smile.
\"Sorry, sir.\"
\"Can I access the computers?\"
He unlocks the door.
\"Certainly.\"
\"I'll log you in.\"
He takes me to the far computer and logs it in.
\"I'm busy, so I must be right back.\"
He measures me for a moment.
\"Don't let the other teachers know I left you alone in here.\"
\"I'll keep it under wraps. Thank you, sir.\"
Maybe he's not so weird, after all.
He leaves and I begin creating and purchasing an account.
\"You're early.\"
I jump to her voice.
I was caught up in creating my account; I didn't notice Mr Brent and the other teachers enter either.
\"I thought I may as well buy an account and get started.\"
\"Good. You're going to need to put some time in if you ever want to surpass noobhood.\"
\"Don't worry, I'm going to beat you one day.\"
\"I'm waiting.\"
She sits down on the other computer and logs into the game.
\"I have a low level Viktese Warrior. I could help you through some low level content if you like.\"
\"Sounds good.\"
\"Join my friends talk.\"
\"Why? We can speak.\"
\"Because then you can see the markers I place.\"
\"Oh, I see.\"
I follow the marker she sets and it leads me to a cave.
I enter on my guard...
It's a small opening with numerous passageways leading off into darkness.
                               : \"Wait up. I'm just messaging my friend.\"
                               : \"I'm already inside.\"
                               : \"I know. Don't die.\"
I refresh my memory of the controls—my sword strikes the wall and draws the attention of nearby rats.
More scurry from the depths of the tunnels.
I hack and slash them but they're tough. I find myself pressed up against the wall.
That's when I notice... my health is low!
I watch my character twist and drop to the ground in dramatic fashion.
A message appears in the clan talk, \"L0stc4us3 died to: rat.\"
Danielle slaps her palm against her forehead, releasing a sigh.
\"You really are a noob.\"
\"There were seven of them…\"
\"You died to a rat...\"
\"Hurry. I'll wait outside.\"
Having no comeback, I do as she says.
I make it back and follow Danielle's lead; she assures to not get cornered by enemies.
We explore the labrinth, sharing the loot we obtain, before coming to a halt at a force field.
                               : \"Ready?\"
                               : \"What for?\"
                               : \"There's a boss in the next room.\"
                               : \"We got this.\"
I say that, but the thought of dying again is niggling me.
She jams a gem into the terminal and the force field dissipates.
I steel myself and follow with caution...
...An empty cavern.
                               : \"Keep your health high.\"
A giant rat crashes through the wall.
The cutscene flings us into action and I dodge debris falling from the ceiling.
                               : \"Take the left, I'll go right.\"
                               : \"On it.\"
It lunges at Danielle so I take the opportunity to strike its rear.
It sweeps around and I avoid its claw. I run around the edge of the room and Danielle strikes it.
A few more strikes and its health nears half of its bar.
                               : \"This isn't too bad.\"
                               : \"Don't die.\"
My blow lowers it below half health.
It screeches in rage and slams the ground; I'm caught in the shockwave.
Damn, it nearly killed me.
                               : \"But seriously, don't.\"
I flee, spamming apples.
                               : \"No pressure.\"
                               : \"Attack it!\"
Danielle's cornered. I strike it in the nick of time.
                               : \"Run! The agro's switched.\"
I sprint, again spamclicking my apples. I can't eat them fast enough
                               : \"What food are you using?\"
                               : \"Apples.\"
I hear a sigh behind me.
                               : \"Keep it busy until I'm charged and run past me.\"
I trail it along the walls.
                               : \"Now!\"
I lure it past Danielle and she unleashes a barrage of blows into its side.
It shrieks and rolls onto its back.
\"Good job, noob.\"
Dammit.
\"Thanks, not bad yourself.\"
She rolls her eyes and cracks a smile.
\"That's where I expected you to die, not entering the cave.\"
\"Alright, you don't have to rub it in.\"
\"Oh, but I do.\"
\"How are you even supposed to kill that thing alone, anyway?\"
\"Boosters help.\"
\"Ah, yeah. I forgot about them.\"
\"Anyway, come on. There's loot through the wall it broke through.\"
There's two chests waiting for us, so we loot one each.
                               : \"Oh wow, I got a rare sword.\"
                               : \"Is it good?\"
                               : \"No. Well yes, at this level.\"
She sends a trade request.
                               : \"Here.\"
\"Thanks. Why'd you give it me?\"
\"You need it more than I do.\"
I don't know whether to take it as a present or an insult...
\"Thanks.\"
We make our way back into town.
\"What posessed you to only bring apples?\"
\"They're five gold each and heal twenty HP; the cheapest potions were fifty gold and only healed one-hundred and twenty.\"
\"Because potions can save your life in certain situations.\"
I match her lifted brow.
\"Hey, I didn't die. At the boss...\"
I'm quick to add.
She shakes her head in dissaproval.
\"Cheap ass. You're buying potions now.\"
\"I will, but you didn't tell me how to gear. How do you expect me to know?\"
\"Apples could've saved you from a rat.\"
I concede to my stupid death.
\"I'll take you through town before the next.\"
We complete another. This time, I didn't die.
\"Good job, noob. You're improving.\"
\"Thanks...\"
Something just irritates me when she calls me noob.
But it's nice to actually recieve some praise from her.
\"I can't deny it was fun, either.\"
\"I need to go to a clan event, though.\"
\"Oh, OK. Thanks, it was fun.\"
We stay in the staffroom until the teachers are ready to leave.
I've gained quite a few levels, but I felt left out being too low to join her clan...
Everyday after class I've been heading down to this Internet_Cafe I found to train my account.
I've found that 4-5pm of Danielle's afterschool schedule consists of raiding with her clanmates.
With my account coming into mid-level, our compatible content has decreased to nothing.
I thought I'd get closer by sticking at it, but now it feels so far before I can play with her again.
x-Destiny-x: Bye.
I notice her message in the chat. It's 4:29pm.
L0stc4us3: Where are you going?
x-Destiny-x: I'm heading into town.
L0stc4us3: Just so happens I'm in the Internet_Cafe on Long Rd.
x-Destiny-x: I'm going to Pot Kettle Black.
x-Destiny-x logged out.
...
After some trouble finding the place, I find her at the back alcove with a strawberry and chocolate icecream in a parfait glass.
\"Y'know, I didn't exactly expect you to go for an icecream.\"
\"If I was alone, then I could eat icecream without being questioned for it.\"
\"Should I go?\"
That smirk.
\"Yeah, go order something.\"
I order a ham and cheese toastie, caught up in a thought as I make my way back.
\"You barely had time to meet me on the roof but you're here ordering ice cream?\"
\"A schedule isn't all work. You need breaks, and you need to reward yourself, too.\"
\"And all it takes is some gaming and a little ice cream?\"
\"If you can't enjoy the simple things, then you'll be waiting a long time.\"
\"What do you enjoy?\"
She asks as the waiter places down my meal.
\"Magnum Dilon and ham and cheese toasties, I guess.\"
She offers a smirk that says point proven and eats a scoop of ice cream.
\"I see you've been levelling up pretty quickly.\"
\"You might even be ready to face me soon, noob.\"
\"Gonna stop calling me noob when I beat you?\"
I’m beginning to enjoy her smirk.
\"I might if you hurry, noob.\"
\"Well, after all, beating you is something I'd enjoy.\"
\"I'd enjoy watching you fail.\"
She plucks a strawberry and crushes it between her teeth.
After all my talk, I realise I'm going to be that strawberry.
I could still put with her company with her calling me noob. I've done it so far, right?
\"Your confidence will be your weakness.\"
\"If you don't me to go easy on you, then keep talking.\"
Her smirk grows with my silence.
\"Weather's nice though today, eh?\"
\"Add another five percent difficulty.\"
\"I wasn't even talking about the fight!\"
\"The terms were that if you talked. I didn't say what about.\"
\"Then am I supposed to be quiet until the fight?\"
\"Although that would be amusing, I do have some sense of fair play.\"
\"Until the end of our lunch. Oh, and that's another ten percent difficulty.\"
So much for fair play.
She chuckles at the scowl I shoot at her.
She inspects her phone.
\"Eat up, I'm heading back soon.\"
We finish eating and I wait until we've left the table until I speak.
\"So much for fair play.\"
\"I didn't extend it to the fight, did I?\"
\"But the terms were too vague!\"
\"If I'd asked now without the additional rules you've added since, then I'd still have the additional five percent difficulty.\"
\"You have a point. I guess if you're going to cry about it, I can let it slide.\"
\"Fine, keep your—\"
\"What are you guys doing here together?!\"
Just as we're finally spending time together...
\"He happened to be town and I was coming here.\"
\"Shouldn't you be on an epic quest?\"
Jennifer's wink raises a scowl from Danielle.
\"Shouldn't you be playing Cupid?\"
\"I've left them alone together.\"
\"Again?\"
\"Yeah, I'm only getting in the way.\"
\"You do know he likes you, right?\"
\"I...\"
Jennifer gives her statement some consideration before her grin resumes.
\"He's not my knight.\"
She delivers it with a wink and Danielle rolls her eyes.
\"You should take this more seriously.\"
Jennifer shrugs.
\"I'll leave it to them. And I'll leave it to you.\"
\"Later.\"
She's gone as fast as she appeared.
\"Are you sure she doesn't know you play it?\"
\"I'm confident.\"
\"Why?\"
\"Believe me, you'd know.\"
Knowing she's not about to make conversation, I release a question on my mind.
\"What are the fastest ways to train at level 15?\"
\"You can kill Breals at the bottom of Julagga Mountains which is chill. But if you want the fastest XP, you'll need to focus on Bragens at the top.\"
\"You should go kill Gloastrians at level 23; you'll find them nearby the Salt Sea.\"
\"Thanks.\"
I have a vision of Jennifer hearing that and look around. Danielle follows in my caution.
\"Bet you're glad Jennifer wasn't here to hear that.\"
She shakes her head.
\"You should be glad, too.\"
...
\"I'll see you tomorrow. I'm gonna train for a few hours.\"
\"Bye.\"
I take Danielle's advice and find the expierence rates much faster.
And I'm only doing the \"chill\" method.
x-Destiny-x: Noob, where are you?
L0stc4us3: I’m training in the Julagga mountains.
x-Destiny-x: Come join our raid.
She must be a player short or something...
L0stc4us3:The monsters are way too high for me.
FauxCuss: Not sure if you’re smoking the same shit as them; all you have to do is lure and dodge.
x-Destiny-x: Shut up, Luke. You’ll be fine, come on.
I take the comment on the chin with Danielle’s reassurance.
L0stc4us3: Fine.
One thing I've learnt....
L0stc4us3: I really need to level up.
x-Destiny-x: Yeah, noob.
L0stc4us3: I swear I'm going to beat you...
x-Destiny-x: Noob, hurry up. ;)
I've stayed up way too late. I can't believe that place stays open until 11pm.
But I've made some good progress.
I haven't slept well. I've been up most of the night coughing. All I want to do is sleep.
The decision reels through my mind.
I force myself up, locating the attendance number and adding it into my contacts.
I stare at the number, my fingers flex and it's dialling...
I fake a few coughs as a woman's voice breaks the ringing tone.
\"Good morning, you're through to Janette on the Sunnyvale attendance line. How can I help you today?\"
\"Good morning, I'm Peter. I'm feeling a little under the weather today.\"
\"Can I take your student number?\"
\"I'm in Mrs Brown's class.\"
\"Sorry, but I would need to take your number.\"
I fake some coughs as I rummage through my paperwork.
\"...It's 123117.\"
It's done.
I snuggle in my sheets.
But lack of sleep gives my brain time to rearrange priorites.
...
I keep my hood up and my head down.
I make sure to keep my ID on show; I imagine they're told to question anybody without one.
After an energy drink, Danielle's focus suggestion is noticeably faster.
I open my eyes and hover my finger over the call button.
No.
I’ve already called in sick...
But... it would be more believable if I take another day off.
It'd also give me time to get \"better\" over the weekend.
And I’ll actually be useful if I’m able to equip boosters and the steam hammer...
...And I can also get it done by tonight if I focus grind all day...
Saturday's arrived. I haven't spoken to Danielle since Wednesday.
I've had my private chat off...
She doesn't really talk to me in class or when raiding, anyway.
But still, I'm a little worried about how she'll take my absense...
I arrive at the computer room, expecting to see Danielle at a computer by the back but she's not there.
But I notice a familiar grey coat.
\"Hey, Mr Brent. Where's Danielle today?\"
He spins in his chair and shrugs.
\"She hasn't been by today. But you're welcome to use the computers.\"
Danielle's not here? Where could she be?
\"Thanks, I'll come back later.\"
\"Off to find Danielle?\"
His smile makes me want to deny I'm curious...
...but I haven't received a reply from her since this morning.
\"Not sure if I can.\"
\"I'll give you a hint: Danielle might be more creative than you think.\"
More creative than I think...? I don't even know where to begin.
...A piano melody echoes down the corridor.
The music room.
The door yields with a creak.
Danielle turns to me, lifting her fingers from the keys.
\"What are you doing here?\"
\"I heard music... I thought you'd be at the staffroom.\"
\"I was going to go soon. I've just... fallen behind.\"
Her tone leaks with guilt.
\"I just didn't expect you to play.\"
Or fall behind...
\"Not many do.\"
\"Would you play that piece for me?\"
Her eyes flicker in consideration.
\"You'd better not laugh.\"
A smile slithers onto my lips.
\"Now I already want to.\"
If looks could kill...
\"OK, I promise.\"
I hold my hands up and surrender my smile.
She takes a deep breath and meets the keys with her fingers.
Her lips ease as the melody begins, her foot tapping the tempo.
I'm not sure what I thought her secret was to begin with, but it wasn't this.
She rocks back and forth, captured by her music.
I'm captivated by her...
\"...Wow.\"
\"It's nothing.\"
Her face betrays her with a notch of red. I'm wary of the smile threatening to creep on my lips.
\"You wrote that?\"
\"Yeah. But it's not finished.\"
\"I really do like it.\"
She calms; her shoulders fall slack.
\"Thanks.\"
\"Wait, if Jennifer didn't know you still game, was she was going to suggest that I could play music with you on my first day?\"
Her eyes drop for a moment.
\"Yep. This was it. At least she doesn't try to tease me in public for this.\"
\"It's not something to be embarrassed about.\"
\"I was just never good enough.\"
She states it as a trivial fact.
\"You're very good. Haven't you thought about making music for your game?\"
\"Maybe, one day.\"
\"Why weren't you in class?\"
She turns the topic on its head with a narrowed brow. I'd almost forgotten...
\"I was ill.\"
\"You don't look ill now.\"
Her probing questions evoke a pang of guilt.
\"I'm feeling quite a lot better today after some sleep.\"
\"Oh, really. Did you get to level twenty-four in your sleep?\"
Red-handed.
\"I thought I might as well train with the time off.\"
She sighs and shakes her head.
\"I'd tell Mrs Brown that you're going to make up for it, if you know what's good for you.\"
\"I will. I'll dedicate Monday and Tuesday night to make up for it.\"
\"Good.\"
\"But c'mon, we might aswell do some raids now that I can be useful.\"
She smirks and shakes her head.
\"If you use any more school time to train, then I'ma call you noob forever.\"
\"Deal.\"
\"C'mon, noob.\"
\"Meet at Horthorpe Tavern.\"
\"That's miles away, I've left myself by the dungeons.\"
\"We always meet here, sharing drinks at the tavern fortifies health by ten percent for an hour after you leave.\"
\"Oh...\"
The pressure builds as I continue to miss chances to take out the Rillifers.
FauxCuss: Fuck, who invited this noob?
x-Destiny-x: Give him a chance, it's his first time as an attacker.
I message her in private, it'd feel weird to say it aloud.
L0stC4us3: Doesn't he remember me?
x-Destiny-x: Apparently not.
L0stC4us3: Doesn't your clan know I'm your friend IRL?
I take a glance. But she continues in text.
x-Destiny-x: I'll speak to you later.
...
I just can't focus on my school work.
There's extra homework this week, too...
No rest for the wicked.
x-Destiny-x: You'd better not be slacking, noob.
I'm pleasantly surprised she'd check on me.
L0stC4us3: Don't underestimate the noobking. I'm coming for you soon.
x-Destiny-x: lol noob.
I don't want to let her down.
And I'm not sure I'd surive the wrath of both Mrs Brown and Danielle...
Homework looks a little more appealing all of a sudden.
...
Ugh, I'm not accustomed to this. I've at least hit the criteria for each question.
It's 22:34. I wonder if she's still awake.
L0stC4us3: Done.
x-Destiny-x: Good.
A few minutes pass and I'm certain that's all she's going to say.
I just can't leave it at that.
L0stC4us3: Be ready, noob.
x-Destiny-x: Pfft. You better be ready to fight me with talk like that.
We both know I'm not ready.
L0stC4us3: Give me a week...
x-Destiny-x: Hurry up!
x-Destiny-x: Good night.
L0stC4us3: 'Night.
I wasn't expecting her to say goodnight. Maybe in some roundabout way, we're becoming friends.
Well, I'd better get an early night, rested for a grind after school tomorrow...
Warm rays lay on my skin, a cool breeze meets my nose with a salty fragrance.
I place down the last castle and revel in our creation.
\"Good job, high five!\"
I make two legged finger men and duel on the battlements.
\"Peter! Here’s your ice cream.\"
Ice cream!
\"This one's for my little architect.\"
\"Thank you, mummy!\"
\"This one's for me.\"
\"None for daddy!\"
\"I helped, too!\"
Delicious.
With my ice cream finished, I'm ready to play.
\"Where's daddy?\"
Water sprays up my back and the question is answered.
\"Run!\"
We take cover behind the sand castle.
Mummy pulls out some water bombs and water pistols.
\"I’ll distract him and you get him!\"
A sand tower crumbles from water gun fire.
\"Go go go!\"
She lobs a water bomb over the battlements and runs in.
I take the opportunity to flank him and throw my water bomb.
\"Hey!\"
Missed! He turns his sights on me.
I flee and fire my water gun aimlessly behind me.
\"You're not getting away that easily!\"
He catches me in his arms and we tumble to the ground.
My body jolts me into consciousness.
I tame my breathing and calm myself.
That... felt so real.
I can't stop thinking about that dream. I've had so many vague nightmares...
But was that really my past?
A memory...?
x-Destiny-x: Noob, how did you even die there?
L0stC4us3: Sorry, zoned out.
x-Destiny-x: You're lucky we'd already taken out the boss.
FauxCuss: Focus, man!
L0stC4us3: I'ma call it for today.
x-Destiny-x: Too much of a noob?
L0stC4us3: I was training to beat you, you're distracting me.
FauxCuss: Ha! I'd pay to see that.
x-Destiny-x: You didn't have to come.
L0stC4us3: Later.
I leave her friends chat to train alone with my thoughts.
I thought it'd distract me from my thoughts.
My mind's scrambled.
Maybe it's because of this gaming with her that I even had that dream?
I'm determined to beat her. I could get the levels I need in a few days.
This noob thing can work to my advantage; if she doesn't know what I'm capable of, I might bypass her defence.
I'll only get one shot... I'll need to practice once I'm ready.
But... who with?
FauxCuss: Sure.
L0stC4us3: Really?
I was expecting an insult.
FauxCuss: If Danielle insists on raiding with you, then you need to carry your own weight.
...
I try to dodge his swing and he catches my side.
FauxCuss: Block!
His attitude is grinding my gears.
L0stC4us3: Right.
I block his blow and dodge his swipe.
FauxCuss: Now, Danielle likes to...
He boosts to my side and delivers a long slash.
FauxCuss: Cleave her enemies. 
L0stC4us3: How can I counter it?
FauxCuss: How long do you think we have?
L0stC4us3: Two days.
FauxCuss: I'm not that committed. Couple hours tonight and tomorrow night.
But I can't deny his help right now. And Danielle will be offline in that time.
L0stC4us3: Alright. Thanks.
He boosts and I boost backwards as he slashes.
FauxCuss: Your reactions could be workable at least.
I boost in and slash, catching a critical on his leg.
L0stc4us3: Let's do it.
He avoids my next swing and thrusts his sword through my back.
...
FauxCuss: Don't get cocky. C'mon, there's a few strategies for each map.
\"So, today's the day?\"
\"Today's the day you stop calling me noob.\"
\"We'll see.\"
I shake the nervousness off and set myself up; but I can't budge the unease in my stomach.
Why am I so nervous?
3... 2... 1... Fight!
We're summoned to the cityscape.
We're both cautious in the approach, gliding past the edge of corporate buildings until we meet on the main street. 
She taunts, her character brandishing her bastard blade. I rush in, attempting to catch her off guard during the animation.
She anticipates and counters with a Vicious Cleave. The blow pierces my armour, dealing additional damage.
I don't falter, engaging her and landing a few blows in her stomach chinks.
She retreats; I charge at the scent of blood.
She evades my attacks, darting around the building on her boosters. I dash the first corner, but run the next to reserve fuel.
She shoots ahead of me, anticipating a dash on boosters.
So that's her game? She wants me to rush in. With pleasure.
I'm quick to react, boosting around her and landing an Incense Strike.
She rolls away from my next strike and extinguishes the fire damage.
I swipe in but she blocks and we exchange blows.
Lag freezes time for a moment; my blow slips through her defence and strikes a critical.
                               : \"Mother...\"
Her health bar goes red. I lunge in and she parrys my strike and I stumble.
Her sword protrudes through my chest and I'm slammed into the ground.
Her name slams the screen and I restrain myself from slamming the desk.
\"These lag spikes have only started since you've moved here...\"
\"All a part of my master plan.\"
She rolls her eyes at my joke.
\"God forbid you actually beat me because of lag.\"
\"And I can't have you complaining you would've beat me if there wasn't lag.\"
She delves into her screen
\"Ugh, they've added new software.\"
She lowers her voice; eyes still locked on the screen.
\"I've been told not to tinker, but turning a few programs off should be fine.\"
Her eyes widen a notch; her lips tighten flat.
\"There's something tracking these computers...\"
I barely catch the words under her breath.
\"Wha—\"
She places her finger on her lips.
I write out a question as she delves back into the screen.
Why would anybody track these computers?
She glances and resumes.
I didn't think Danielle would be so paranoid.
I remain quiet as she she browses her computer. It's awkward.
She motions to leave; her computer screen fades to black.
I'm baffled.
I try to form a question, but I'm overwhelmed with how much I want to ask.
\"Why would anybody track them? And why would that effect us?\"
She bares her teeth and contains herself.
\"They can track everything we do; where we are. Who we are...\"
Maybe they can help me find who I am.
\"You think someone's trying to track you?\"
Her eyes flick to me and over my shoulder.
\"Peter. Danielle.\"
He greets us each with a nod and furrows his brow.
\"It's Saturday. Shouldn't you guys be gaming?\"
\"We believe there may be someone tracking the computers.\"
His brow remains furrowed but his lips harden.
\"Tracking the computers, huh?\"
\"That could be a serious offense if someone unauthorised can access the network.\"
His voice calm and monotone. Why is everyone acting so weird?
\"Please, show me what you've found.\"
Danielle proceeds to show him her findings. Mr Brent waves them away.
I'm left non the wiser.
I follow her out into the carpark. There's a few cars in the lot, but nobody's around.
\"Danielle?\"
Her stoic expression is betrayed by her features flickering in thought.
\"The VPN on my laptop means nothing if he's able to access the school's network.\"
\"Who?\"
She sighs.
\"I'm not sure. It could be Luke.\"
\"What do you mean? He's your friend.\"
\"You can't trust anyone.\"
\"He helped me train for this fight, because he knew you wanted to bring me along in game.\"
\"It's not likely. But it's possible.\"
\"Why would anybody be tracking you?\"
Her breath catches in her throat and she relaxes with a sign.
\"I've been stalked before.\"
\"I played with him online a few years back and we got close.\"
\"But when we started drifting apart, he got controlling; so I said goodbye.\"
There's a chink in her voice.
\"But he found my adress through my IP and began stalking me.\"
\"He had spoken to me in the street a few times and he was strange. I didn't know what he looked like then.\"
\"I didn't realise it was him until I woke up at two am with him at the end of my bed.\"
She looks ashamed in herself for it.
\"You couldn't have known. But that doesn't mean that you have to suspect luke.\"
My mind shoots to her threatening to ring the police when I told her I was here.
\"Did you suspect me, too?\"
Her nostrils flare.
\"It's not a bad thing to suspect you.\"
I assure to keep a calm tone.
\"Definitely not. But do you trust me?\"
\"I do.\"
It's a relief to hear.
\"Then you have to let me know if you find out anything else.\"
\"You shouldn't have told him.\"
\"Told who?\"
\"That new teacher. He's right; it's likely nothing. I feel stupid for it.\"
\"But something just doesn't feel right.\"
\"It'll be fine. C'mon, want to go to Pot Kettle Black while we're out?\"
\"No, thanks. I'll see you Monday.\"
She marches inside.
\"B-bye...\"
Her body language makes me not want to follow.
I thought she might want to spend some time together, take her mind off things.
But what if she's seriously being stalked?
Her paranoia makes me uneasy, but I just can't help feel that it's not the case.
I just wanted to be there for her. To make her feel comfortable.
Her confirming words play in my head.
I do.
Do you trust me, though?
Does she have a reason to? We've played Club Seal and Magnum Dilon together.
I get the feeling she wouldn't have told me about her music if I hadn't found her.
She doesn't even trust Jennifer enough to tell her about her gaming.
Maybe I'm just looking too much into everything.
But maybe she's right.
Someone's actually trying to track her. And I'm here doubting her.
I talk about friendship and trust, yet I don't trust her with this.
And even with how calculated she is, she's seriously concerned.

L0stc4us3: I'll pass, thanks.
She doesn't respond.
...
Three months later.
So much for this \"new life.\"
I thought there would be more to it than this. But all I do is seclude myself and stew in my room.
Solitude is a hard won ally—an ally I've never made.
I trudge along with school work but I'm apathetic to it. I still don't know who I am or what I want, so how can I care?
My semblance of happiness has been enough for me to slip in and out of class and councelling unnoticed.
Everyday it became harder to make connections, so I stopped trying.
I make it to the checkout, offering the chashier a smile. Faux smiles come easy now.
He returns it and scans through my microwave meals, pots of noodles, cans of cola and bottles of water.
I bought appliances for my room so the only reasons I have to leave is for the toilet or class.
\"That's nine ninety-five, please.\"
I hand him a ten and leave with my bags.
The evening's cold air embraces me. The only thing that will.
I spot a familiar grey coat approaching in the crowd. The man's jawline is slim and his cheeks are etched with lines of age. 
I catch his gaze as he walks by; his eyes narrowed, emanating malice.
Icy fingers grasp my heart.
Is he... following me?
No, he can't be. I'm just being paranoid.
I scan through the crowd again but he's nowhere to be seen.
I cut down a side street.
It's quiet down here, at least.
I rack my brain but I can't remember where I've seen that man before.
Not that I care if anything—
My body jolts to every gunshot.
I drop to my knees wide-eyed; bags spilling from my fingers.
My fingers follow the warm, sticky liquid up to my chest. The pain of touching it steals the last breath from my lungs.
The ground rushes up to meet me. My last thought wondering if I'd ever lived...
